# Engine patches (fteqw `fteqw64.exe`)

Custom modifications to the FTEQW engine for the nettest mod. These live in the
engine **source tree** at `C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine` and must be
**re-applied + rebuilt** whenever you pull a new upstream fteqw, because they
fork the engine. The deployed binary is `C:\FTEQuake\fteqw64.exe` (the previous
build is kept as `fteqw64.exe.prev` for rollback).

## Build / deploy

```powershell
# ucrt64 toolchain on PATH; incremental (only changed .c recompiles + relink, ~10-30s)
$env:PATH = "C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin;C:\msys64\usr\bin;$env:PATH"
& "C:\msys64\usr\bin\make.exe" -C "C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine" m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64
# output: engine\release\fteqw64.exe  -> copy over C:\FTEQuake\fteqw64.exe (back up the old one to .prev first)
```
`m-rel` = the merged GL+VK+SW+server win64 client (the deployed target). A
harmless `pattern recipe did not update peer target p_script.d` warning may
print; the `.o` and `.exe` still build.

**RULE (2026-07-23, learned the hard way): every exe rebuild must also rebuild
and redeploy ALL native plugins** — `fteplug_{hl2,cod,box3d,ode}_x64.dll`:

```powershell
& "C:\msys64\usr\bin\make.exe" -C "C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine" plugins-rel FTE_TARGET=win64 NATIVE_PLUGINS="hl2 cod box3d ode"
```

Plugins compile engine headers (`gl_model.h`, `com_mesh.h`, `shader.h`) into
their DLLs, and the engine's plugin gate only checks the *function table*
(`sizeof(plugmodfuncs_t)` + `MODPLUGFUNCS_VERSION`) — there is **no data-struct
canary**, so a stale plugin loads silently and corrupts memory at map load. A
Jun-15 `fteplug_hl2` against a Jul exe (model_t had 48 bytes inserted
mid-struct) made **every HL2/CSS map stall on load** with no error. APPEND-ONLY
field discipline protects existing offsets but NOT array strides (a plugin
that allocates arrays of `galiasinfo_t` bakes the old stride in), so
rebuilding everything together is the only safe rule. Two traps in the plugin
build itself: bare `plugins-rel` (no NATIVE_PLUGINS) dies on an unrelated
ffmpeg target, and the plugin makefiles do **not** track engine-header deps —
after a header change, `rm engine/release/fteplug_*_x64.dll` first or make
will happily report "nothing to do". The scratchpad `build_fte.ps1` does the
full set (m-rel + sv-rel + plugins).

**WORSE (found the same day): the ENGINE's make doesn't track header deps
either.** After the model_t layout change, `make m-rel` rebuilt only **7 of
213** client objects — the linked exe mixed old-layout and new-layout code and
SIGSEGV'd at VBSP load (crash stack: engine frame called from
`VBSP_GenerateMaterials`). `make clean` does not clean the win64 object dirs.
After ANY engine-header change, force a full recompile: touch every
`*.c/*.cpp/*.h` under `engine/` (or delete all `.o`/`.d` under
`release/m_mgw64` + `release/sv_mingw64`), then rebuild. `build_fte.ps1 -full`
does exactly this.

## Patch 1 — `watercliptype` (rain splashes on water surfaces)

**File:** `engine/client/p_script.c`  ·  search the source for `nettest`

**Why:** particle collision (the `cliptype` splash) traces against
`MASK_WORLDSOLID` (= `FTECONTENTS_SOLID | FTECONTENTS_WINDOW`), which **excludes
water** (`FTECONTENTS_WATER` is a fluid). So a clipping rain drop falls straight
*through* a water surface and only splashes on the solid floor beneath. There is
no cfg-only fix — the engine never reports a water "hit" for collision particles.

**What it adds:** a new opt-in per-particle-type field `watercliptype` (mirrors
`cliptype`). When set, a clipping particle that crosses the air→water boundary
spawns that effect at the refined surface point (via a cheap `PointContents`
test — no extra trace) and dies, instead of falling through. Lets the rain throw
a **separate, bigger** splash on water (`weather.cfg` `r_part splashbig`) vs the
land splash.

**The 5 edit sites** (all tagged `//nettest`):

1. **Struct field** — in `part_type_t`, after `int cliptype;`:
   ```c
   int watercliptype;	//nettest: ... P_INVALID = off.
   ```
2. **Init A** — in the type-reset (after `ptype->cliptype = P_INVALID;` ~line 517):
   ```c
   ptype->watercliptype = P_INVALID;	//nettest
   ```
3. **Init B** — in `P_NewParticleType` (after the other `ptype->cliptype = P_INVALID;`):
   ```c
   ptype->watercliptype = P_INVALID;	//nettest
   ```
4. **Parser** — after the `else if (!strcmp(var, "cliptype"))` block:
   ```c
   else if (!strcmp(var, "watercliptype"))	//nettest
   {
       assoc = P_AllocateParticleType(config, value);
       ptype = &part_type[pnum];
       ptype->watercliptype = assoc;
   }
   ```
5. **Detection** — in the collision block `if (type->cliptype>=0 && r_bouncysparks.ival)`,
   immediately after `int e;` and **before** the solid `CL_TraceLine`: a
   `PointContents`-based air→water crossing check that binary-refines the surface,
   sets `p->die = -1`, and `P_RunParticleEffectType(surface, '0 0 1',
   clipcount/watercliptype.count, watercliptype)` then `continue;`. Gated on
   `type->watercliptype != P_INVALID` so snow / other clippers are untouched.
   Full block is in the source with a `WATER-SURFACE SPLASH` comment.

**Mod side (`particles/weather.cfg`):** `r_part rain` gets `watercliptype splashbig`;
`r_part splashbig` is the bigger/higher water splash. On an **unpatched** engine
the `watercliptype` line just warns and is ignored (harmless), and water rain
falls through as before.

**Cost:** +1 `PointContents` per clipping drop per frame (much cheaper than the
`CL_TraceLine` already running); the binary search only runs for drops actually
crossing a surface.

---

## Patch 2 — `waterringtype` (per-drop water ripple ring)

**File:** `engine/client/p_script.c` · search `waterringtype` (all sites tagged `//nettest`)

**Why:** the engine-path water *ring* used to be a QC random sampler (`Rain_WaterRingTick`) that fired ~dozens of downward `traceline`s per frame to *guess* where water was — so the rings didn't land on actual drops. With Patch 1, the engine already knows the exact air↔water point each drop crosses. This patch reuses that point to spawn a **second** effect (the flat ripple ring) right there, so rings land on real drops like the CSQC pool does — and the QC sampler is deleted.

**What it adds:** a per-type field `waterringtype` (sibling of `watercliptype`). In the same water-crossing branch as Patch 1, if `waterringtype` is set, spawn it at the refined surface point. **No extra trace/search** — it reuses Patch 1's computed point.

**The 5 edit sites** (mirror Patch 1, tagged `//nettest`):
1. **Struct** — `int waterringtype;` after `int watercliptype;`.
2/3. **Inits** — `ptype->waterringtype = P_INVALID;` after each `ptype->watercliptype = P_INVALID;`.
4. **Parser** — a `waterringtype` case after the `watercliptype` case (same `P_AllocateParticleType` body).
5. **Detection** — in Patch 1's crossing branch, before the `watercliptype` spawn:
   ```c
   if (type->waterringtype != P_INVALID)
       P_RunParticleEffectType(wlo, wnormal, 1, type->waterringtype);
   ```
   Spawn count `1` → the ring effect's own `count` IS the density.

**Mod side:** `r_part rain` + `rain_cheapsplash` get `waterringtype ringsplash`; `r_part ringsplash` is `type udecal` (flat) with **`count 0.5`** = ~50% of water hits spawn a ring (the density/speed dial; lower = fewer/faster). The QC `Rain_WaterRingTick` sampler was **removed** from `client/cl_rain.qc`, so `cl_weather_waterring` / `cl_weather_waterring_rate` no longer affect the engine path — tune via the ringsplash `count` instead. Unpatched engine: the `waterringtype` line warns + is ignored (no engine-path rings).

**Cost:** essentially free — one extra cheap particle spawn on water-crossing drops only (reuses Patch 1's surface point); net *cheaper* than before since it removed the ~64-traceline/frame QC sampler.

## Patch 3 — oriented-box (`SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX`) player/bullet collision

**File:** `engine/server/world.c` · search `World_OBBTrace` and `FTE patch` (tagged in comments)

**Why:** FTE has no smooth *oriented* collision hull for movable props (the Source/VPhysics
convex-hull equivalent). Player movement and hitscan trace through `World_Move →
World_ClipMoveToEntity → World_TransformedTrace`, and that function's box-hull branch
(`model==NULL`) **ignores the entity's angles** — so `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX` (and `SOLID_BBOX`) only ever
collide as an *axis-aligned* AABB. The two existing alternatives are both bad for a prop you stand
on: an axis-aligned box can't tilt, and `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` (per-triangle `Mod_Trace`) is
oriented but the player wedges/stutters on triangle seams. FTE's only smooth-oriented collision is
BSP brush clip-hulls (`Q1BSP_RecursiveHullCheck`), which alias models can't use.

**What it adds:** `World_OBBTrace()` — the box analogue of the BSP/alias rotated trace. For a
`SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX` entity **with non-zero angles**, it rotates the trace into the box's local frame
(mirroring the alias `r_meshpitch`/`r_meshroll` convention so collision lines up with the rendered
model), clips against the player-expanded **axis-aligned** box hull, then rotates the result plane
normal back to world space. The cabinet is a box, so an oriented box == its true convex hull ==
Source-parity for that prop: smooth like a hull, no per-triangle bumpiness, follows any tilt. Same
path serves the player pmove (server + CSQC) **and** hitscan, so shooting a tumbling box hits its
real shape too.

**The 3 edit sites** (all tagged `FTE patch`):
0. **`World_LinkEdict`** — the "expand for rotation" condition (which enlarges `absmin/absmax` for
   tilted brushes) gains `|| solid == SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX`, so a rotated physics box's tilted corners
   aren't area-grid-culled before the oriented narrowphase runs. Only rotated boxes are affected;
   axis-aligned ones keep the tight AABB.
1. **`World_OBBTrace`** — new static fn placed right after `World_TransformedTrace`. Builds the
   rotation from the **raw** entity angles (`AngleVectors` + right-hand `VectorNegate`, NO
   `r_meshpitch`/`r_meshroll` flip — the IQM renders with raw angles, so applying the alias mesh-pitch
   pitched the collision box the wrong way vs the model), Minkowski-expands the prop box
   by the **rotation-projected** player extents (so the expansion is correct under rotation; a point
   trace = exact ray-vs-OBB), rotates start/end via the axis, runs `Q1BSP_RecursiveHullCheck` on the
   shared `box_hull`, then rotates `trace.plane.normal` back with `Matrix3x3_RM_Invert_Simple` +
   interpolates `endpos` (copied from the proven BSP path `q1bsp.c:1579-1608`).
2. **`World_ClipMoveToEntity`** — before the final `else World_TransformedTrace(...)`, a branch:
   `else if (solid == SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX && !model && (eang[0]||eang[1]||eang[2]))` →
   `World_OBBTrace(...)`. Scoped strictly to `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX` so `SOLID_BBOX` (items, players)
   keeps its cheap axis-aligned behaviour.

**Critical correctness note:** the patch **rotates the TRACE, never the hull planes** — the shared
`static box_hull` (`world.c:68`) stays axis-aligned, so the per-entity clip loop is not corrupted.
(Rotating the global plane set would also break its axis-aligned `.type` fast-path and clobber the
next entity's trace.)

**Mod side:** the filing cabinet (`server/sv_physprop.qc`) is `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX` always now
(velocity-carry works on a box; collision is oriented via this patch) — the TRIMESH/solid-swap layer
was removed. On an **unpatched** engine the cabinet simply degrades to an axis-aligned box (old
behaviour) — no crash.

**Cost:** a few dot products + one matrix invert per `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX`-with-angles entity per
trace; nil for axis-aligned entities (skipped) and for resting (`angles≈0`) props.

## Patch 4 — engine-particle rain/weather splashing on phys props  *(APPLIED — see "As built" below)*

**File (when done):** `engine/client/r_part.c` (`CL_TraceLine`) + `engine/client/p_script.c` (the clip
collision near the `WATER-SURFACE SPLASH` block, ~line 7578).  Search `nettest` once applied.

**Why:** with `cl_weather_engine 1`, engine rain collides via `p_script.c` →
`CL_TraceLine(p->oldorg, p->org, …)` → `World_Move(&csqc_world, …, MOVE_NOMONSTERS, …)` (`r_part.c:891`).
`MOVE_NOMONSTERS` keeps `SOLID_BSP` (so rain splashes on brushwork) but **skips `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX`/
`SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH`**, so rain falls straight through the filing cabinet / barrels / cans.

**The catch (why it's not a 1-word change):** simply using `MOVE_NORMAL` would also collide rain with
**live other players** — they're `SOLID_BBOX` in `csqc_world` (`client/cl_player.qc:4121`) — and it
would break the carry wall-clamp, which relies on `MOVE_NOMONSTERS` skipping props so a carried prop
can *push* others (`server/sv_physprop.qc` Carry_Tick clip-and-slide).  So the clean version must hit
**phys props only**, not players, and must not change the global `MOVE_NOMONSTERS` semantics (several
QC traces depend on it).

**Planned approach (props-only, scoped):**
- Add a per-particle-type flag `clipprops` to `part_type_t` (mirror the `watercliptype` patch: struct
  field + 2 `P_INVALID`/0 inits + a parser case).
- Add a dedicated trace `CL_TraceLineProps()` in `r_part.c` (copy of `CL_TraceLine`) that traces
  `csqc_world` with `MOVE_NORMAL` **but ignores `SOLID_SLIDEBOX`/`SOLID_BBOX`/`SOLID_CORPSE`** (players/
  corpses) — i.e. keep only world + `SOLID_BSP` + `SOLID_PHYSICS_*`.  Cleanest is a tiny solid-class
  filter inside the trace, or give phys props a dedicated dimension bit and trace that.  NOTE the
  cabinet is a local csqc entity (`World_ClipToAllLinks`) while barrels/cans are packet entities
  (`World_ClipToNetwork`, encoded `ES_SOLID_BSP`) — both are reachable from the `csqc_world` move, so
  one trace covers all three.  The cabinet's oriented box is handled by Patch 3's `World_OBBTrace`.
- In `p_script.c`'s clip collision (~7578), when `type->clipprops` is set, run that trace (in addition
  to / instead of the world `CL_TraceLine`) and splash `cliptype` at the impact.
- Mod side: `weather.cfg` `r_part rain` gets `clipprops 1`.  Unpatched engine: the cvar warns + is
  ignored (rain falls through props as today — no crash).

**As built (APPLIED):** done with a scoped engine move flag (cleaner than the MOVE_NORMAL-minus-filter
sketch above). 5 files:
- `engine/common/world.h`: `MOVE_HITPROPS (1<<9)`.
- `engine/server/world.c`: a `SOLID_ISPHYSPROP()` macro + relaxed the `MOVE_NOMONSTERS` skip at the
  two compiled `World_ClipToLinks` loops (~1841 areagrid, ~2086 areanode) so `SOLID_PHYSICS_*` props
  pass **only** when `MOVE_HITPROPS` is also set. Plain `MOVE_NOMONSTERS` is unchanged (no existing QC
  trace sets the new bit).
- `engine/client/r_part.c` (+ proto in `client.h`): `CL_TraceLineProps()` — one
  `World_Move(&csqc_world, …, MOVE_NOMONSTERS|MOVE_HITPROPS, …)` sweep hits world BSP **and** props in a
  single trace (same trace budget). `World_OBBTrace` (Patch 3) already returns a **world-space** normal,
  so splashes aim correctly off the cabinet's tilted faces.
- `engine/client/p_script.c`: per-type `int clipprops` (field + 2 inits + parser, mirroring
  `watercliptype`); the cliptype collision (~7590) routes through `CL_TraceLineProps` when `clipprops` is set.
- `particles/weather.cfg`: `clipprops 1` on `rain`, `rain_cheapsplash`, and the three `snow*` types.

**Scope:** only the **cabinet** (`SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX`) is hit — correcting the planning note above:
barrels/cans are `SOLID_NOT` on the client (manual CSQC ray-vs-cylinder override in `cl_physprop.qc`,
to protect predicted pmove), so the engine trace doesn't reach them. The `SOLID_ISPHYSPROP` macro
includes `TRIMESH`, so they're covered automatically if ever made solid client-side. Graceful
degradation: on a stock engine the `clipprops` key hits the parser's `Con_DPrintf` fall-through
(developer-only) and is ignored — no crash, rain behaves as today.

---

## Patch 5 — `r_part_splashlimit` (per-frame splash-effect cap, decoupled from collision)  *(APPLIED)*

**Why:** the engine-weather collision couples "the drop dies/stops at a surface" with "a splash effect
spawns" — both happen together in the cliptype block of `engine/client/p_script.c`. So there was no way
to cap splash *spawns* independently of collision, and `r_particle_tracelimit` only bounds the expensive
land `CL_TraceLine` calls — the **water** path uses cheap `PointContents` (Patch 1), not a trace, so it
ignored the trace limit entirely. User wanted (a) a real per-frame **splash** cap shared across land +
water, decoupled from the die, and (b) `cl_rain_splash 0` to STOP rain at BSP/props without splashing.

**As built (2 files + cfg):**
- `engine/client/r_part.c`: new cvar `r_part_splashlimit` (default `0x7fffffff` = unlimited), declared
  next to `r_particle_tracelimit` and registered alongside it.
- `engine/client/p_script.c`: `extern` it; init `int splashes=r_part_splashlimit.ival;` next to
  `int traces` (~6995); wrap the impact-splash spawns with `if (splashes-->0){...}` at the **water**
  ring+splash spawns (~7579-7581) and the **land** cliptype spawns (~7680-7686). Only the
  `P_RunParticleEffectType` spawns are gated — every `p->die=-1` kill and every `continue` stays
  unconditional, so drops still STOP at the surface; only the splash is capped. The single `splashes`
  counter is shared land+water+ring (one decrement per impact). Decals (`clipbounce -2`) and snow's
  splashless death (`clipbounce -1`, no spawn) consume nothing.
- `particles/weather.cfg`: `rain_nosplash` (what `cl_rain_splash 0` selects) gained `clipbounce -1`
  (auto cliptype=self → die on contact via the `clipbounce<0` path, NO splash spawn) + `clipprops 1`
  (die on the rotated cabinet too). Its header comment was updated (it changed from "fall through" to
  "collide+die, no splash").

**Knobs after this:** `r_particle_tracelimit` = land trace COST cap; `r_part_splashlimit` = splash-effect
cap (land+water+ring); `r_bouncysparks 0` = whole-collision off switch. Stock engine ignores the new
cvar (just an unknown cvar) — harmless.

---

## Patch 6 — fix manifest `steam:` gamedir on Windows (mount Steam GoldSrc/HL dirs)  *(APPLIED, upstream bug)*

**Why:** a `.fmf` manifest line like `basegame steam:Half-Life/cstrike` / `steam:Half-Life/valve` (to mount a
Steam Half-Life/Counter-Strike install so GoldSrc maps find their `.wad`s + skyboxes without copying) **silently
did nothing on Windows** — the mounted dir never appeared and map textures stayed missing. This is an upstream FTE
bug, not a config error: the manifest `steam:Subdir/gamedir` resolver (`fs.c` ~5377) verifies the folder by calling
`Sys_SteamHasFile(..., dir, "")` with an **empty filename**, and the Windows `Sys_SteamDirsWithFile` (`fs.c` ~5737)
does that check with `VFSOS_Open(".../cstrike/", "rb")` — i.e. it tries to **open the directory as a file**, which
always fails on Windows (Linux uses `access()`, which works on dirs). It *also* passed the empty `fname` (not the
resolved path) to the result callback, so even a passing probe would have mounted nothing.

**As built (1 file, `engine/common/fs.c`):** in the Windows `Sys_SteamDirsWithFile`, when `fname` is empty, check
the GAMEDIR DIRECTORY's existence with the engine's own `GetFileAttributesU(basepath) != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES`
(forward-declared just above the function; it's defined further down) and pass the **resolved absolute `basepath`**
to the callback. The non-empty path (the normal Quake/Q2/Q3/Hexen2 Steam auto-detect) is byte-for-byte unchanged —
the new behaviour only fires for the manifest `steam:` empty-filename case. Result: `basegame steam:Half-Life/cstrike`
now resolves via `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Valve\Steam\SteamPath` + `/SteamApps/common/Half-Life/cstrike` and mounts it
read-only (`SPF_COPYPROTECTED`). GoldSrc wad lookup already strips the map's embedded wad path to the basename and
searches all mounted gamedirs (`wad.c` ~780-839), so the wads + `gfx/env` skyboxes are then found automatically.

**Known limitation:** the Windows resolver only checks Steam's MAIN install (registry `SteamPath`); it does not parse
extra Steam *library* folders (`libraryfolders.vdf`) the way the Linux path does. Half-Life in the main library works;
a second-drive library would need a junction or a `libraryfolders.vdf` parse (future). Verify a mount with the `path`
console command (the steam dirs should be listed).

---

## Patch 7 — `r_builtinpalette` (don't let a mounted game's palette/colormap override yours)  *(APPLIED)*

**Why (a direct consequence of Patch 6):** mounting a Steam Half-Life/CS dir for its TEXTURES also drags in its
`gfx/palette.lmp` (HL color palette) and `gfx/colormap.lmp` (HL fullbright/lighting ramp). FTE loads those
**globally** (`client/renderer.c` host_basepal load ~1561 + colormap ~1591), and this mod ships **neither** of its
own (it relies on the engine's built-in `default_quakepal` at renderer.c:1352, with `vid.fullbright` 0). So the
mounted HL palette+colormap WON the search and replaced ours for the whole game → **green/wrong colours on ALL
content (world BSP, models like the snowball, brush entities) and random fullbright pixels** (HL's colormap flips
`vid.fullbright` on). Not a func_illusionary/entity issue — a global palette swap. There's no FSLF flag to skip
copyprotected paths for a file load, so a cvar is the clean fix.

**As built (1 file, `client/renderer.c`):** new archived cvar `r_builtinpalette` (default 0). When set to 1, the
`gfx/palette.lmp` and `gfx/colormap.lmp` `FS_LoadMallocFile` calls are skipped (`r_builtinpalette.ival ? NULL : ...`),
so host_basepal falls back to the built-in `default_quakepal` and `vid.fullbright` stays 0 — exactly the pre-mount
state. HL **textures** are unaffected (WAD3 carries a per-texture embedded palette), so CS maps still render right.
Def + `Cvar_Register` near gl_conback (~795). Default 0 = no change for anyone not setting it.

**Use:** set it EARLY (before the renderer loads the palette) — add `set r_builtinpalette 1` to the `.fmf` manifest
(alongside the `basegame steam:` lines), or `r_builtinpalette 1` in config + `vid_restart`. General rule: whenever you
mount an external game for assets only, set this so its palette/colormap can't override yours.

---

## Patch 8 — `fs_load` (mount external games ON DEMAND at LOW priority)  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/common/fs.h` (1 line) + `engine/common/fs.c` (5 sites)  ·  search for `nettest` / `P8`

**Why:** mounting Steam games via `basegame steam:Half-Life/cstrike` lines in the `.fmf` mounts them at the
**HIGHEST** search priority — each basegame is *prepended* to the head of `com_searchpaths` (`fs.c` `FS_AddPathHandle`
~4347), so the search order became `cstrike > valve > nettest` (the mod LAST/lowest). Consequences: the mounted
`valve/gfx/conback.lmp` overrode the mod's console image; FTE's config-write target (`FS_BASEGAMEONLY`) picked the
last/Steam basegame; and the higher-priority foreign `config.cfg` could flip `vid_fullscreen` (window→fullscreen).
They were also always mounted, not on demand.

**What it adds:** three console commands — **`fs_load <game>` / `fs_unload <game>` / `fs_loadlist`** — that mount an
external game **at the LOWEST priority** (appended to the *tail* of `com_searchpaths`, so its assets/maps only fill
gaps and the mod's own files always win — no conback/config/video override). `<game>` accepts **`steam:Game/dir`**
(reuses the Patch-6 `Sys_SteamHasFile` resolver), an **absolute path** (`C:\…` / `C:/…`), or a **relative dir**. The
mounted dir's sub-packages (`.wad`/`.vpk`/`.iwd`/`.pk3`/`.pak`) load too, so GoldSrc, Source (VBSP/.vpk) and CoD1
(.iwd) maps work after a load (CoD2 needs the `.ff` pre-extracted — see [[fte-cod-hl2-map-support]]). The set is
persisted to **`<gamedir>/fs_addons.txt`** (one entry per line) and **auto-remounted on every searchpath rebuild**, so
it survives `fs_restart`/`gamedir` and across launches.

**The 5 edit sites** (all tagged `//nettest` / `P8`):
1. `fs.h` — new flag `#define SPF_ADDON 4096` (append-at-tail, loads sub-packages, no pure/server semantics).
2. `fs.c` `FS_AddPathHandle` (~4319) — add `SPF_ADDON` to the `(SPF_TEMPORARY|SPF_SERVER)` append condition.
3. `fs.c` end of `FS_ReloadPackFilesFlags` (~5637) — `if (reloadflags) FS_RemountAddons(reloadflags);` (single
   rebuild path both startup and `fs_restart` hit). Forward-declared near the `FS_ReloadPackFilesFlags` proto.
4. `fs.c` before `COM_InitFilesystem` — the implementation block: `FS_Addon_Resolve` (steam:/absolute/relative →
   syspath), `FS_Addon_Mount` (dedup + `VFSOS_OpenPath` + `FS_AddPathHandle` with `SPF_ADDON|SPF_COPYPROTECTED|
   SPF_PRIVATE|SPF_ISDIR`), `FS_RemountAddons` (read `fs_addons.txt`, mount each), `FS_Addon_SaveList`
   (add/remove a line), and the `FS_Load_f`/`FS_Unload_f`/`FS_LoadList_f` command handlers.
5. `fs.c` `COM_InitFilesystem` (~8457) — `Cmd_AddCommandD` for `fs_load`, `fs_unload`, `fs_loadlist`.

**Mod side:** `C:\FTEQuake\default.fmf` — the two `basegame steam:…` lines were **removed** (replaced by a comment).
`C:\FTEQuake\nettest\fs_addons.txt` seeds the low-priority mounts (`steam:Half-Life/valve` + `steam:Half-Life/cstrike`)
so the mod still works out-of-the-box. Keep `set r_builtinpalette 1` in the manifest (Patch 7 still applies — the HL
palette is still mounted, just at low priority). With the mod now highest-priority, its `default.cfg` (`vid_fullscreen
0`) wins → **windowed**, and config writes go to `nettest/`.

**Console-image caveat:** the mod ships **no** `gfx/conback`, so the lookup still falls through to the low-priority
`valve/gfx/conback.lmp` (valve's image). To use your own, drop `nettest/gfx/conback.lmp` (or `.tga`/`.png`) — being
higher priority it then wins. (Mounting valve only for assets can't selectively hide its conback; providing your own
is the fix.)

**Verified:** windowed launch (log: `Setting windowed mode`), de_dust2 loads, `path` shows `nettest (e)(w)` above
`$system/valve (c)` + `$system/cstrike (c)` (mod wins), `fs_load C:/…` + `fs_loadlist` + persistence all work. Stock
upstream engine without this patch: `fs_load` is just an unknown command (the `.fmf` would need the old basegame
lines back).

**P8 follow-up (sub-package priority) — REQUIRED for correctness:** `FS_AddPathHandle` strips most flags from the
mask it passes to `FS_AddDataFiles` (fs.c ~4315), so an addon dir's *sub-packages* (`.wad`/`.iwd`/`.vpk`/`.pk3`/`.pak`)
were NOT inheriting `SPF_ADDON` → they mounted at HIGH priority (prepended) even though the dir itself was low.
Symptom: mounting CoD (whose `.iwd` packages carry their own `default.cfg`) made the engine exec CoD's `default.cfg`
instead of nettest's → **fullscreen + plug_load lines skipped**. Fix: add `SPF_ADDON` to the mask at fs.c ~4315 so
sub-packages also append at low priority. Also fixed the `fs_load` command to accept an **unquoted path with spaces**
(`fs_load C:\games\Call of Duty\Main`) via `Cmd_Args()` (new `FS_Addon_Arg` helper). Verified: CoD mounted → windowed
+ all 3 plugins load.

**P8 follow-up 2 (skip foreign configs):** when the mod has no `config.cfg`/`autoexec.cfg` of its own, the startup
config-exec (`engine/client/cl_main.c` ~7824/7826, `exec config.cfg` / `exec autoexec.cfg`) fell through to a mounted
game's (valve's GoldSrc `config.cfg` + `autoexec.cfg`→`violence.cfg`/`controller.cfg`) → dozens of `Unknown command
"cl_*/gl_*"` AND it silently ran valve's binds/cvars over the user's. `SPF_UNTRUSTED` does NOT help (it only lowers the
exec permission level, still finds+execs). Fix: new `qboolean FS_FileIsAddonOnly(const char *name)` in fs.c (FS_FLocateFile
+ check `loc.search->flags & SPF_ADDON`); cl_main.c skips `exec config.cfg`/`exec autoexec.cfg` when their top hit is in
an `SPF_ADDON` dir. `default.cfg` is NOT guarded (the mod ships its own, found first). Verified: foreign-config spam = 0.
(The empty `C:\FTEQuake\valve\` + `\cstrike\` `data\scripts\` folders were leftovers from the basegame era — `fs_load`
uses `FS_AddPathHandle` which never sets `gamedirfile`, so FS_GAMEONLY writes go to nettest; the stubs don't refill.)

## Patch 9 — CoD2 (.d3dbsp) BSP material-index bounds guards  *(APPLIED, plugin)*

**File:** `plugins/cod/codbsp.c` (the **cod plugin**, not the engine — rebuild with `make plugins-rel
NATIVE_PLUGINS=cod CC=gcc`, deploy `engine/release/fteplug_cod_x64.dll` → `C:\FTEQuake\fteplug_cod_x64.dll`).

**Why:** loading some CoD2 maps (e.g. mp_harbour) crashes once the CoD assets are mounted; with the game unmounted the
geometry loads fine. Cause: the CoD2 BSP loader reads a brush/patch **material index** straight out of the BSP and
indexes `prv->surfaces[mat]` / `mod->textures[in->mat]` with **no bounds check** (the code even comments *"is this
right? … feels wrong though"*). A bad/out-of-range index → out-of-bounds read → crash.

**Fix (4 sites, tagged `//nettest`):** clamp `mat` to `< mod->numtexinfo` (the surface/shader count = the size of
`prv->surfaces[]`), falling back to index 0, at `CODBSP_LoadBrushes` (~1195, ~1206/1225), `CODBSP_BuildBIH` patch-tri
(~1547), and made the unexpected-patch-mode `Con_Printf` (~1317) stop dereferencing `textures[in->mat]`. A bad index
now uses a default material instead of crashing. (CoD2 `.iwi` pixelformat 6 is separately unsupported but fails
*gracefully* in codiwi.c — not the crash.) NOTE: rebuilding the cod plugin needs `CC=gcc` (the plugin Makefile
defaults to `cc`, absent in ucrt64) and prints a harmless `Error 127` from the optional post-link `zip`/EMBEDMETA step
— the `.dll` is already built before that.

## Patch 10 — Source/HL2 skybox loading (find + decode `.vtf` faces)  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shader.c` (`Shader_ParseSkySides` patterns) + `engine/client/image.c` (`r_defaultimageextensions`)  ·  search `nettest`

**Why:** Source/HL2 (VBSP) maps rendered a BLACK skybox. The worldspawn `skyname` (e.g. `sky_day01_04_hdr`)
builds a sky shader `skybox_<name>`, but two things were missing: (1) the engine sky-side loader never tried the
Source layout `materials/skybox/<name><side>.vtf` (only `<name>_<side>`, `<name><side>`, `env/…`, `gfx/env/…`);
and (2) even with the right path, `R_LoadHiResTexture` never probed the `.vtf` extension — `r_defaultimageextensions`
listed only dds/ktx/tga/png/jpg/pcx, so the face file was never found/decoded. (The VTF decoder itself already lives
in the hl2 plugin `img_vtf.c` and runs the moment a `.vtf` is read into memory by name.) Net: every face missed →
`r_blackimage`; and because all 6 faces × 6 patterns × 2 suffix-sets always missed, changing `r_skybox` did a full
Source-`.vpk` search per combo = very slow (felt like a level reload).

**As built (2 sites, tagged `nettest`):**
- `gl_shader.c` `Shader_ParseSkySides` (~668) — added `"skybox/%s%s"` and `"materials/skybox/%s%s"` to
  `skyname_pattern[]`. Source side suffixes (`rt/bk/lf/ft/up/dn`) already matched the existing suffix set; only the
  directory prefix was missing.
- `image.c` `r_defaultimageextensions` (~99) — appended `" vtf"` **last** (native tga/png/dds keep priority; Source
  assets resolve to `.vtf` only when nothing else exists). `R_ImageExtensions_Callback` re-parses on registration.

**Result:** `materials/skybox/<name>rt.vtf` is now found, decoded by the plugin VTF loader, and the per-face loop
**breaks on first hit** → correct sky AND fast `r_skybox` changes. Set `r_skybox <skyname>`. Stock engine (no `.vtf`
extension): Source skyboxes stay black, no crash.

**Known follow-up:** Source "compressed HDR" faces store R8G8B8E8 (shared-exponent); `mat_vmt.c:133` doesn't
decompress that, so such a face decodes DARK (not black). If a specific `_hdr` sky looks dark, remap its skyname to
the LDR base (`sky_day01_04`) or extend `img_vtf.c` to transcode R8G8B8E8. True-float (RGBA16F) HDR VTF decodes fine.

## Patch 11 — quiet CoD Q3-style shader-directive spam  *(APPLIED)*

**File:** `engine/gl/gl_shader.c` (`Shader_Parsetok` + new `Shader_IsKnownIgnoredDirective`)  ·  search `nettest`

**Why:** CoD/CoD2 `.stype` materials (routed through FTE's shader parser by `plugins/cod/codmat.c`) use Q3-style
directives FTE doesn't implement (`nvTexShader`, `waterMap`, `perlight`, `sunfile`, `tessSize`, `radialNormals`).
Each hits `Con_DPrintf("Unknown shader directive …")` — already developer-gated, but with `developer 1` on (needed to
read real errors) hundreds per map flood the console. Demoting can't help (already DPrintf; user runs developer).

**As built (1 site):** a `Shader_IsKnownIgnoredDirective()` helper (the 6 known CoD keywords) above `Shader_Parsetok`;
the unknown-directive guard gains `&& !Shader_IsKnownIgnoredDirective(prefix?prefix:token)`. The line is still consumed
by the existing "Next Line" loop, so parsing is unchanged; **any other** unknown token (typos, broken Q3 shaders) still
warns. Extend the `ignored[]` array for more benign CoD keywords (but NOT real FTE keys like `nomipmaps`).

---

## Patch 12 — `Cbuf_GetNext` is `//`-comment-aware  *(APPLIED)*

**File:** `engine/common/cmd.c` (`Cbuf_GetNext`)  ·  search `nettest`

**Why:** `particles/weather.cfg` (and any r_part/menu script with inline `//` comments) printed spurious
`"<word> is not a recognised particle type field"` warnings (`the`, `true`, `dev-warn`). Cause: `Cbuf_GetNext` split
command lines on an unquoted `;` but was NOT `//`-comment-aware (unlike its sibling `Cbuf_ExecuteLevel`). A `;` *inside*
a `//` comment (e.g. `…floor); the…`, `…patch; dev-warn`) split the line, and the post-`;` fragment lost its `//`
prefix so its first word was parsed as a particle field.

**As built (1 site):** added a `comment` flag to the `Cbuf_GetNext` scan loop (mirrors `Cbuf_ExecuteLevel`): once `//`
is seen on a physical line, a subsequent `;` no longer splits it. `\n` is checked first so an unterminated comment
still ends at the newline; quote handling unchanged; non-comment lines tokenize identically. `common/` file → affects
client + dedicated server. The cfg needs no edits.

---

## Patch 13 (plugin) — CoD static-prop spawning · foliage non-solid · `modelscale` · xmodel robustness  *(APPLIED, cod plugin)*

**Files:** `plugins/cod/codbsp.c` + `plugins/cod/codmod.c` (cod plugin — rebuild `make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=cod
CC=gcc`, deploy `engine/release/fteplug_cod_x64.dll` → `C:\FTEQuake\fteplug_cod_x64.dll`)  ·  search `nettest`

**What it adds (all tagged `nettest`):**
- **Placed-prop spawning** (`codbsp.c` `COD_LoadProps` + `CODBSP_PrepareFrame`): CoD has no static-prop lump — props
  are entity-lump `script_model`/`misc_model` entities with `model "xmodel/<name>"`. `COD_LoadProps` parses them
  (2-pass count+fill); `CODBSP_PrepareFrame` renders each via `NewSceneEntity` (threaded `GetModel`). Any other
  xmodel-bearing class is logged once under `developer 1`.
- **`modelscale`** (`COD_LoadProps`): parse the entity `modelscale` key → `ent->scale` (default 1). Big rocks authored
  at `modelscale >1` were rendering at base size (≈¼) because the key was ignored.
- **Foliage non-solid** (`codbsp.c` `CODBSP_LoadShaders` ~897): CoD foliage materials carry `SOLID` in the BSP
  material contents → player collides with every leaf. After reading `surfaces[mat].c.value`, clear
  `SOLID|WINDOW|PLAYERCLIP|MONSTERCLIP|BODY` when the material name contains **`foliage`** (all CoD foliage is named
  `foliage_masked@…`/`foliage_detail@…`, incl. grass-blades & bushes). **One** edit covers both CoD1 (mode0/mode1
  patch) and CoD2 (brush) collision — both derive contents from this single source. Rendering is independent of
  `c.value`, so foliage still draws. NOTE: an earlier version also matched bare `grass`/`bush`, which wrongly hit a
  WALKABLE grass-ground displacement on CoD1 dam and dropped the player through the terrain — match `foliage` ONLY.
- **xmodel loader robustness** (`codmod.c`): (a) the CoD1 strip-decoder no longer aborts the whole model on a
  `ntris != t` mismatch — it renders what decoded (degenerate-tri stripping legitimately yields t<ntris on big
  multi-strip rocks); (b) bound the per-LOD `tex[64]` write so material-rich models can't smash the stack; (c) name
  missing `xmodelparts/`/`xmodelsurfs/` sub-files under `developer 1` (was a silent skip).

**Graceful degradation:** all of the above are additive — a stock cod plugin just renders no props and keeps foliage
solid; no crash. NOTE the same `CC=gcc` + harmless `zip` `Error 127` caveat as Patch 9.

## Patch 14 — quiet Source `.vmt` console spam (5 categories) + collapse interior `//` in paths  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `plugins/hl2/mat_vmt.c` (A/B/C) + `engine/gl/gl_shader.c` (D) + `engine/common/common.c` (E)  ·  search `nettest`

**Why:** loading a Source/HL2 (VBSP) map flooded the `developer 1` console with hundreds of `.vmt` material lines,
burying real errors. The plugin's `Con_DPrintf` is a BINARY `developer!=0` gate (no level arg, and the plugin SDK
exposes only `Con_Printf`/`Con_DPrintf`), so "demote to developer 2" is impossible plugin-side — the fix is
recognise-and-skip (same pattern as Patch 11), except category E which is a real path bug we FIX.

**As built:**
- **A — per-field echo** (`mat_vmt.c` `VMT_ParseBlock`): ~41 recognise-but-ignore branches were pure
  `Con_DPrintf("%s: %s \"%s\"\n", …)` traces (`$nodecal`, `$detail`, `$AllowAlphaToCoverage`, …). Replaced the echo
  with `;` (keeps any store on the preceding line). These keys are deliberately handled, so nothing is hidden.
- **B — Unknown field** (`mat_vmt.c` final `else`): added `VMT_IsKnownIgnoredField()` (`$nolod`/`$model`/
  `$FlashlightNoLambert`) + an `else if (…) ;` before the warning. A genuinely novel/malformed key still warns.
- **C — Unknown block** (`mat_vmt.c` sub-block `else`): added `VMT_IsKnownIgnoredBlock()` (prefix match
  `vertexlitgeneric`/`lightmappedgeneric`/`unlitgeneric`/`worldvertextransition`/`proxies`) for Source's per-DX/HDR
  shader-variant sub-blocks + Proxies. Any other block name still warns.
- **D — leaked shader directives** (`engine/gl/gl_shader.c` `Shader_IsKnownIgnoredDirective`, the Patch-11 helper):
  the VMT→FTE-shader generator emits Q3 pass-only keywords (`rgbgen`/`alphagen`/`alphatest`) and blendfunc args
  (`src_alpha`/`one_minus_src_alpha`/`one`/`zero`/…) at the shader TOP LEVEL, where they fall through to "Unknown
  shader directive". Added those tokens to the ignore list. Collision-free: they aren't in the top-level
  `shaderkeys[]`, and inside a real `{ }` pass block `rgbgen`/etc. match `shaderpasskeys[]` FIRST.
- **E — `//` path bug** (`engine/common/common.c` `COM_CleanUpPath`): a stray interior `//` in a Source `.vmt`
  material ref (e.g. `props_wasteland//bridge_railing`) was never collapsed (the function strips leading `/` and
  resolves `..` but not interior `//`), producing `Error: empty directory name (…//…vmt_glsl.vmt)` (a `Con_Printf`,
  always shown) + a wasted lookup. Added an interior-`//`→`/` collapse pass after the leading-slash strip. URL `://`
  never reaches here (handled earlier). This is a FIX, not suppression.

**Net effect:** `developer 1` stays useful — a malformed `.vmt`, a real novel unknown field/block, or a genuine
unknown shader directive STILL warns; only the benign Source-asset flood is silenced. Two rebuilds: hl2 plugin
(A/B/C; `make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc` → `fteplug_hl2_x64.dll`) + engine (D/E; `make m-rel`).

---

## Patch 15 — round-2 Source/CoD shader-spam quiet (GLSL permutations, conditional-operator leak, imagesize, skin) + extended VMT ignore-lists  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shader.c` (2 sites) + `engine/gl/gl_alias.c` (1) + `plugins/hl2/mat_vmt.c` (extends Patch 14's two allow-lists)  ·  search `nettest`

**Why:** after Patch 14, Source/HL2 + CoD maps still flooded `developer 1` with a second, larger wave of benign warnings — all confirmed cosmetic (rendering is correct):
- **GLSL `Unknown pemutation in glsl program vmt/vertexlit#…`** (the dominant one — hundreds of lines): the hl2 plugin's
  `vmt/vertexlit`/`vmt/lightmapped` GLSL programs declare `!!permu NOFOG` and `!!permu AMBIENTCUBE`, which aren't in the
  engine's 8-entry bitmask permutation table, so `Shader_LoadPermutations` (gl_shader.c:1998) warns once per *distinct*
  program name — and mat_vmt builds a unique name per material (env-tint/sat/mask combos), so the same 1–2 tokens re-fire
  as hundreds of differently-named lines. The features (envmap/tint/mask/nofog) come from `#define` injection, NOT the
  permu table, so the failed registration changes nothing. FIX: recognise + skip `NOFOG`/`AMBIENTCUBE` in the
  force-defined whitelist (mirrors `TESS`/`SPECULAR`/…), and demote the surviving generic print to `Con_DLPrintf(2,…)` so
  any *other* unknown permu only whispers at developer 2.
- **CoD `||`/`<` leak** (CoD1 `stalingrad` water, a burst at load): NOT codmat — CoD1 world textures resolve to CoD's own
  Q3-style text `.shader` files, and an `if(...)` conditional that continues an operator onto the next line leaves the
  leading `||`/`<` orphaned (the evaluator stops at the newline), read as a bogus top-level directive. FIX: added
  `||`/`&&`/`<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=`/`==`/`!=` to `Shader_IsKnownIgnoredDirective` (an operator is never a valid directive). (Did
  NOT add bare `s` — too generic.)
- **`console: "imagesize"`**: codmat.c emits a no-op `imagesize` metadata line into every CoD material; added to the ignore list.
- **`Skin number out of range (car003a.mdl)`**: a 1-skin Source `.mdl` asked for skin index 1; falls through to a valid
  skin (cosmetic). Demoted the throttled print (gl_alias.c) from developer 1 → 2.

**Plus** (extends Patch 14's hl2 `mat_vmt.c` allow-lists — applied in-source): `VMT_IsKnownIgnoredField` +=
`$parallaxmap`/`$parallaxmapscale`/`$cheapwaterstartdistance`/`$cheapwaterenddistance`; `VMT_IsKnownIgnoredBlock` +=
`animatedtexture`/`texturescroll`/`waterlod`/`water_` (prefix, covers `Water_DXxx`) + a leading-char test that skips any
block starting with `>`/`<`/`=` (the Source DX-version conditional blocks `>=dx90`/`<DX90`).

**Net:** `developer 1` on a Source/CoD map is now down to genuinely-useful lines (real missing-content `Couldn't load
sound`, the mod's own `SERVERINFO`). Real shader/material typos, novel unknown fields/blocks, and genuinely-unknown
permutations (now at developer 2) still surface. Two rebuilds: engine (gl_shader.c + gl_alias.c) + hl2 plugin.

---

## Patch 16 — guard the sprite renderer against a non-sprite / failed model (Source `.vmt` sprite crash)  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/client/renderer.c` (R_GetSpriteFrame) + `engine/gl/gl_alias.c` (R_Sprite_GenerateTrisoup) +
`engine/gl/gl_model.c` (warning names the file)  ·  search `nettest`
**+ Mod QC (git-tracked, not an engine patch):** `server/sv_env_sprite.qc`, `server/sv_cycler_sprite.qc` (reject `.vmt`)

**Why:** loading a Source/HL2 map containing `env_sprite`/`cycler_sprite` entities (e.g. **d1_canals_01**) CRASHED on
load. Those entities' `model` key is a Source SPRITE MATERIAL (`.vmt`, content begins `"Sprite"`/`"SpriteCard"`). The
mod QC's `precache_model(self.model)` + `setmodel` feeds the `.vmt` to the engine MODEL loader; no loader matches a
`.vmt` so `gl_model.c` falls through to `mod_dummy`/MLS_FAILED (the `Unrecognised model format "Spr…` warning). One
frame later the sprite renderer derefs it: `R_GetSpriteFrame` (renderer.c:2538) did `psprite = model->meshinfo; …
psprite->numframes` with NO type/NULL check, and a dummy has `meshinfo == NULL` → segfault. Every OTHER model path
guards `mod_dummy`/MLS_FAILED; the sprite path was the one gap. No `.dmp` exists because FTE's minidump writer is
`#ifdef _MSC_VER` and this is a **mingw** build — the cause came from the flushed `-condebug` `qconsole.log` (the last
line before the crash was the model warning; see the crash-logging note below).

**As built (engine — the load-bearing guard):**
- `renderer.c` R_GetSpriteFrame: `if (currententity->model->type != mod_sprite || !psprite) return NULL;` before the deref.
- `gl_alias.c` R_Sprite_GenerateTrisoup (the sole LIVE caller; the other at :1964 is inside `#if 0`): added `if (!frame)
  return;` after the call (was `shader = frame->shader;`, which would itself NULL-deref on the new NULL return).
- `gl_model.c:1340`: the "Unrecognised model format %c%c%c%c" warning now also prints `mod->name` (was anonymous) — a
  permanent diagnostic win for any future unrecognised model.

**As built (mod QC — the root cause):** `env_sprite`/`cycler_sprite` now reject a `model` ending in `.vmt` (`dprint`
+ `remove(self)`), so the bad precache never happens (the Source glow is simply absent instead of a dummy). `.spr`/`.mdl`
sprites still work. Recompile: `fteqcc64_latest.exe progs.src` from `nettest/src` → `qwprogs.dat`.

**Result:** d1_canals_01 (and any Source map with sprite entities) loads instead of crashing. Either layer alone stops
the crash; both together also remove the warning + the useless dummy entity. Rebuilds: engine (`make m-rel`) + QC progs.

### Capturing an FTE crash in this build (mingw, no minidump)
`fteqw64.exe`'s `MiniDumpWriteDump` is `#ifdef _MSC_VER` → **no `.dmp` from the mingw build**. Instead use the flushed
console log: launch with **`-condebug +set developer 1`** (the `C:\FTEQuake\fte_debug.bat` launcher does this). The log
is written **per-line, open/append/close** (`log.c:210`, `"ab"`) to **`C:\FTEQuake\nettest\qconsole.log`** (`log_root =
FS_GAMEONLY` = the mod gamedir), so the tail survives a crash — the **last line before the crash usually names the
asset/lump** that killed it. (On a hard segfault FTE *also* pops a "KABOOM!" dialog with a DBGHELP stack-walk and copies
it to the clipboard — but the stripped exe + mingw/DWARF means it's mostly raw addresses; the `qconsole.log` tail +
`developer 1` is the practical tool.)

## Patch 17 — void green-tint, HL2 HDR-sky banding, and the d1_canals_01 crash guards  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/client/view.c` (void tint) + `plugins/hl2/mat_vmt.c` (sky LDR) + `plugins/hl2/mod_vbsp.c` (2 crash
guards + 3 temporary breadcrumbs)  ·  search `nettest`

- **Void green tint** (`view.c:733` `V_SetContentsColor`): noclipping into the VOID resolved the eye contents to
  `FTECONTENTS_SOLID`, which was grouped with the SLIME case → the dark-green slime cshift (`0 25 5 150`) on every map.
  FIX: `else if (contents & FTECONTENTS_SLIME)` (was `& (FTECONTENTS_SLIME | FTECONTENTS_SOLID)`) — pure SOLID/void now
  falls through to `v_cshift_empty` (alpha 0 = no tint). Real slime/water/lava tints (each its own bit) unchanged.
- **HL2 HDR skybox banding** (`mat_vmt.c` ~163): HL2 campaign sky `.vmt`s ship a compressed-HDR face
  (`$hdrbasetexture`/`$hdrcompressedtexture`, R8G8B8E8-packed-in-BGRA8) that `img_vtf` reads as plain BGRA8 — the shared
  exponent is dropped → banded/dark. CS:S skies ship only an LDR `$basetexture` and look fine. FIX: split the combined
  key test so `$basetexture` (LDR) is authoritative and the two HDR variants are skipped. (Fallback if a map ships
  HDR-only sky: decode R8G8B8E8→E5BGR9 in `img_vtf.c` — not done, easy to get the exponent bias/channel order wrong.)
- **d1_canals_01 crash** (loads, then SIGSEGVs ~500ms in with audio, no log/dump — diagnosed via [[fte-crash-logging]]):
  two safe speculative guards in `mod_vbsp.c` `VBSP_PrepareFrame`/`VBSP_LightPointValues`:
  - **H1 (primary):** the displacement render loop appended `surf->sbatch->mesh[surf->sbatch->meshes++]` with NO
    `visframe` dedup, unlike the leaf walk — a displacement face present in both a leaf's marksurfaces AND the dispinfo
    list is emitted twice, overrunning the once-per-surface-sized batch mesh array → heap corruption → a *delayed*
    crash (fits the ~500ms). d1_canals beds are displacement-heavy; CS:S isn't. FIX: `if (surf->visframe ==
    vbsp_surfsequence) continue; surf->visframe = vbsp_surfsequence;` before the emit (mirrors the leaf walk; the
    sequence is bumped per-frame so it can only prevent the overrun, never wrongly cull).
  - **H2 (secondary):** `VBSP_LightPointValues` read `leafs[leafnum]`/`leaflight[leafnum].count` before bounding
    `leafnum` (a prop near the void can resolve out-of-range) → OOB read. FIX: clamp `leafnum` to `[0,numleafs)`.
  - **Breadcrumbs (TEMPORARY, `Con_DPrintf` = developer-1 only):** `[bc] VBSP_PrepareFrame: displacements/staticprops/done`
    bracket the two phases so if it still crashes, the `qconsole.log` tail (via `fte_debug.bat`) shows which phase died.
    **Remove these once the crash is confirmed fixed.**

Rebuilds: engine (`make m-rel`) + hl2 plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc`).

## Patch 18 — static-prop PVS culling + GL-backend NULL guards (d1_canals crash, 2nd cause)  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `plugins/hl2/mod_vbsp.c` (prop cull) + `engine/gl/gl_backend.c` (2 guards + temp breadcrumbs) +
`engine/client/r_surf.c` (temp breadcrumbs)  ·  search `nettest`

- **Static props never culled** (`mod_vbsp.c` `VBSP_PrepareFrame` static-prop loop ~3604): the loop only rejected by
  fade distance + model loadstate, then `NewSceneEntity()` unconditionally — so props drew through area portals (visible
  with `r_showtris 1`, world geo culled but props not). FIX: before the lighting/emit, (1) populate `src->pvscache`
  first (moved up), (2) `if (surfvis && !VBSP_EdictInFatPVS(mod, &src->pvscache, surfvis, areas)) continue;` — the same
  PVS/area cull the displacement loop already uses (pvscache.leafnums hold clusters, surfvis is the cluster-PVS →
  index-consistent), and (3) a cheap `VBSP_CullBox` frustum cull on the radius box. `surfvis==NULL`
  (portal-recursion/novis) still draws everything. See [[vbsp-staticprop-pvs-cull]].
- **d1_canals_01 crash — 2nd cause** (the env_sprite fix (P16) + the displacement/leaf guards (P17) got it loading, then
  it SIGSEGV'd in the first frame's render *backend* — breadcrumbs confirmed `VBSP_PrepareFrame` completes). Root cause:
  `gl_backend.c:1280` `case T_GEN_FULLBRIGHT: t = shaderstate.curtexnums->fullbright;` was the **only** `T_GEN_*` texture
  case that dereferenced `curtexnums` with NO null/loaded guard (every neighbor uses `curtexnums && TEXLOADED(...)`). On
  a Source map a prop/material whose texnums aren't resolved on frame 1 has `curtexnums == NULL` → fault. FIX: guard it
  like the neighbors (`… ? …->fullbright : r_nulltex`). Plus a defensive `if (!sh) return;` in `GLBE_SubmitBatch`
  (gl_backend.c:5190) for the portal/depthmask loops that call it directly past the sortlist `!bs` guard.
- **d1_canals_01 crash — ACTUAL 2nd cause** (the FULLBRIGHT/SubmitBatch guards above are good hardening but were NOT it —
  the breadcrumbs showed the crash hit BEFORE the backend, in the gap right after `VBSP_PrepareFrame: done`): the only
  call there is `CL_LinkStaticEntities` (`engine/client/cl_ents.c:3676`), whose guard was `if (!clmodel ||
  clmodel->loadstate == MLS_LOADING) continue;` — it skipped only `MLS_LOADING`, so a static entity with a **FAILED/dummy
  model** (a Source model that didn't load) passed through and crashed in the bounds/PVS/axis setup below. FIX: `!=
  MLS_LOADED` (skip anything not fully loaded, matching every other model-use site).
- **Breadcrumbs:** the temporary `[bc]` `Con_DPrintf`s (this patch's `r_surf.c`/`gl_backend.c` + P17's `mod_vbsp.c`
  `VBSP_PrepareFrame` ones) were **all removed** once the crash was localized — search confirms zero `[bc]` remain.

Rebuilds: engine (`make m-rel`) + hl2 plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc`).

## Patch 19 — d1_canals crash (3rd cause: NULL curtexnums) + Source model brightness + VMT proxy/field spam  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_backend.c` (crash) + `plugins/hl2/mod_vbsp.c` (brightness) + `plugins/hl2/mat_vmt.c` (spam)  ·  search `nettest`

- **d1_canals_01 crash — 3rd cause** (the `CL_LinkStaticEntities` P18 fix held; the crash moved into the prop GLSL
  draw): a `combine_fenceglow` static prop (VertexLitGeneric → `program "vmt/vertexlit"` → GLSL path) whose material is
  registered-but-not-yet-generated has `defaulttextures == NULL`, so `GLBE_DrawMesh_List`/`GLBE_SubmitBatch` set
  `shaderstate.curtexnums = NULL` (the `else` branches at gl_backend.c:5133/5158/5203), and `BE_RenderMeshProgram`
  (gl_backend.c:3940) dereferences it with no guard (the GLSL sibling of the P18 `T_GEN_FULLBRIGHT` bug). FIX: a
  file-scope `static texnums_t r_nulltexnums;` (zeroed) and `… = X->defaulttextures ? X->defaulttextures : &r_nulltexnums;`
  at all 3 sites — `TEXLOADED()` on zeroed texids is false, so the prop draws untextured for a frame instead of faulting.
- **Source model brightness "all over the place"** (`mod_vbsp.c` `VBSP_LightPointValues`): the per-leaf ambient-cube is
  decoded correctly (`ColorRGBExp32`, exponent applied) but for HDR leaf-ambient it's *unbounded linear*, and it was
  pushed through `M_LinearToSRGB(x, mag=1)*256` with no exposure → bright leaves blew past 255 (white), dark stayed tiny
  → 20× spread straddling the clamp. FIX: cvar defaults `hl2_lt_srgb_mag 1→0` (disable the sRGB curve) and `hl2_lt_scale
  256→160` (decoded-linear × 160 stays in 0..255); both runtime-tunable. Also fixed a directional bug at
  mod_vbsp.c:4041/4044 (`res_dir[0]` used for all 3 axes → leaned every prop's shading toward +X; now `res_dir[j]`).
  (If bright leaves still clamp, the follow-up is a Reinhard cap before the scale; not applied yet.)
- **VMT proxy/field spam**: (1) the `else` that warns "Unknown block" became `else if (st)` — only the material TOP level
  warns; nested sub-blocks recurse with `st==NULL`, so every proxy entry inside `Proxies`
  (GaussianNoise/PlayerProximity/Add/Subtract/Sine/Clamp/…) is now silent. (2) extended `VMT_IsKnownIgnoredField` with the
  common benign top-level fields ($multipass/$fresnelreflection/$modelmaterial/$texture2/$no_fullbright) + the
  COMBINESHIELD proxy result-vars ($gnoise/$playerdistance*/$alpharesult*/$smallamount/$largeamount/$hundred/$ten/…).

**Still pending:** the proper **R8G8B8E8 HDR sky decode** (HL2 sky residual banding) — a dedicated 4-file change
(engine `render.h` `IF_HDRDECOMPRESS` flag + `gl_shader.c` `$hdr:` name-prefix; plugin `mat_vmt.c` signal + `img_vtf.c`
R8G8B8E8→RGBA32F decode). Tracked, not yet built.

Rebuilds: engine (`make m-rel`) + hl2 plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc`).

## Patch 20 — d1_canals SPAWN-IN crash: water-reflection NULL forcedvis + unguarded BIH NativeTrace  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_rmain.c` + `engine/common/com_bih.c` + `engine/server/world.c` + `plugins/hl2/mod_vbsp.c`  ·  search `nettest`

After P16–P19 the map LOADS and renders the team-select overview for seconds, then SIGSEGVs the instant the player
SPAWNS IN to first-person. developer-2 QC trace ends at `[spawn] picked info_player_start at 892 2636 74.9 — CS-FALLBACK`.
The spawn point and the team-select camera are **different locations**, so the crash is in a subsystem only exercised by
rendering/colliding **from the spawn point**. Two candidate paths; all four guards are pure NULL/bounds checks (applied
together, none can change correct behavior):

- **Water reflection recursion** (top suspect — canal water enters frame at the spawn point but not at the overview
  camera): `GLR_DrawPortal`'s refraction loop (gl_rmain.c:1220-1239) sets `r_refdef.forcevis=true` as soon as a mesh has
  `xyz_array`, but `forcedvis` is only assigned by `ClusterPVS` (can stay NULL — empty mesh / div-by-zero centroid at
  :1229 when `numvertexes==0` / ClusterPVS miss). `VBSP_MarkLeaves` (mod_vbsp.c:3463-3495) then did `vis =
  refdef->forcedvis` and dereferenced it (`vis[cluster>>3]`) with no NULL check → SIGSEGV. FIX: (a) mod_vbsp.c:3466 —
  `if (!vis) return NULL;` (falls into the existing whole-model/all-surfaces fallback); (b) gl_rmain.c:1223 — skip
  degenerate meshes (`!mesh->numvertexes`) so the centroid can't div-by-zero and leave `forcedvis` NULL.
- **BIH collision trace** (the other candidate — the first predicted/real PMOVE box-traces the *separate* BIH collision
  tree `mod->cnodes`, never touched by the render PVS path): two `funcs.NativeTrace` calls were unguarded vs their
  siblings. FIX: (c) `com_bih.c` BIH_MODEL *Test* case (~1196) — `if (!model || loadstate!=MLS_LOADED || !NativeTrace)
  return;` (a flushed/non-collidable static prop; the sibling `BIH_RecursiveTrace` already guards loadstate); (d)
  `world.c:915` server worldmodel trace — add `&& model->funcs.NativeTrace` (the CSQC/hitmodel paths already null-check
  it; the box-hull `else` at world.c:941 is the safe fallback).

No breadcrumbs added (the guards cover both subsystems). If it STILL crashes, the next step is dev-2 `[bc]` breadcrumbs
at `GLR_DrawPortal`/`VBSP_MarkLeaves` (render) vs `World_TransformedTrace`/`BIH_Trace` (collision) to pick the path.

Rebuilds: engine (`make m-rel`) + hl2 plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc`).

## Patch 21 — compressed-HDR (RGBS) sky decode: kill the residual HL2 sky banding  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/client/render.h` + `engine/gl/gl_shader.c` + `plugins/hl2/mat_vmt.c` + `plugins/hl2/img_vtf.c`  ·  search `nettest`

Supersedes the P17 stop-gap (skip the HDR face, show the LDR `$basetexture`) and closes P19's "Still pending"
R8G8B8E8 item. HL2 campaign sky `.vmt`s ship a compressed-HDR face the 8-bit LDR `$basetexture` can't match → the
sky gradient bands. The real Source format (verified against the SDK shader — NOT the power-of-2 "shared exponent"
the Valve wiki implies; see [[source-hdr-compressed-sky-decode]]) is **RGBS**: a plain `BGRA8888` VTF where
**alpha is a per-pixel LINEAR scale**, decoded `linear.rgb = srgb_to_linear(rgb/255) * (alpha/255) * 8`
(`sky_hdr_compressed_rgbs_ps2x.fxc`: `result.rgb = rgb*alpha; result *= InputScale`, with `InputScale = 8*$color`
and an sRGB read on rgb). Decoding to float kills banding — the alpha scale carries sub-8-bit gradient precision.

Threaded through the existing `$`-prefix texture-name mechanism (same plumbing as `$cube:`/`$rt:`/`$linear:`):

- **`render.h`** (~466): renamed the free `IF_UNUSED15` → `IF_HDRDECOMPRESS = 1<<15`.
- **`gl_shader.c`** `Shader_SetImageFlags` (~835, before the `else break`): a `$hdr:` name-prefix handler that
  strips `$hdr:` and sets `IF_HDRDECOMPRESS`, so the flag rides the texture name down to the image loader.
- **`mat_vmt.c`**: added `hdrcompressedtex`/`hdrbasetex` to `vmtstate_t`; `$hdrbasetexture` / `$hdrcompressedtexture`
  now STORE their value (were no-op skips). The `UnlitGeneric` sky emit (~420) prefers an HDR face over the LDR
  `$basetexture`: `$hdrbasetexture` (uncompressed `RGBA16161616F`, used as-is — already `PTI_RGBA16F` in img_vtf)
  when present, else `$hdrcompressedtexture` emitted as `map "$hdr:materials/<name>.vtf"` to trigger the decode.
  LDR `$basetexture` stays the fallback when no HDR face exists (CS:S skies → unchanged).
- **`img_vtf.c`** `Image_ReadVTFFile` (post-pass before `return mips`): when `(flags & IF_HDRDECOMPRESS) &&
  vmffmt == VMF_BGRA8`, allocate a per-mip `RGBA32F` buffer (`plugfuncs->Malloc`, `needfree=true`), decode every
  pixel `B,G,R,A → {srgblin[R]*a, srgblin[G]*a, srgblin[B]*a, 1}` with `a = A/255*8` (256-entry srgb→linear LUT
  built once per call; iterates `w*h*depth` so all cube faces are covered), and set `mips->encoding = PTI_RGBA32F`.
  The engine transcodes RGBA32F → RGBA16F/byte on upload (the plugin has no FloatToHalf, so it can't emit RGBA16F
  directly). The original BGRA8 bytes are freed via the existing `mips->extrafree`.

Caveats: `$color` tint ignored (defaults to white); the multi-exposure `sky_hdr_compressed_ps2x` variant (3 textures
@ 0.25/2/16) is NOT handled — only the single-VTF RGBS path. If the sky reads too dark/bright, the knob is the `*8`
InputScale or the sRGB linearization in `img_vtf.c`.

Rebuilds: engine (`make m-rel`) + hl2 plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc`). **Build note:** when
building from a sandboxed shell, export a writable `TMP`/`TEMP` first — a `C:\WINDOWS` TMP makes gcc fail with
"Cannot create temporary file" / Error 127 (the compiler never even runs).

## Patch 22 — HDR skybox via the ENGINE sky loader (Patch 21 patched the WRONG path)  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shader.c` (`Shader_ParseSkySides`)  ·  search `nettest`

Patch 21 added the `$hdr:` decode to `mat_vmt.c`'s UnlitGeneric path — but the HL2 **skybox** never goes through a
VMT material. worldspawn `skyname` (wad.c:1016) → `R_SetSky` (gl_warp.c) → the 6 faces load as RAW IMAGE FILES via
`R_LoadHiResTexture` in `Shader_ParseSkySides` (gl_shader.c:701) with `IF_NOALPHA|IF_CLAMP|IF_LOADNOW` — **no
`IF_HDRDECOMPRESS`** — so the (correct) img_vtf decode never fired for the sky and it kept banding. Verified the real
HL2 asset naming from the mounted VPK: each sky ships an LDR face `<skyname><side>` AND a compressed-HDR face
**`<skyname>_hdr<side>`** (e.g. `sky_day01_01rt` + `sky_day01_01_hdrrt`).

FIX: in `Shader_ParseSkySides`, wrap the existing pattern×suffix probe in a 2-pass loop — **pass 0** builds
`hdrname = "<texturename>_hdr"` and loads with `IF_HDRDECOMPRESS|IF_CLAMP|IF_LOADNOW` (alpha kept — it's the HDR scale);
**pass 1** is the original LDR face with `IF_NOALPHA|IF_CLAMP|IF_LOADNOW`. First hit wins, so an HDR face is preferred
and decoded (img_vtf rgb*alpha*8), falling back to LDR when no `_hdr` variant exists (CS:S / older skies → unchanged).
Flags flow straight through `image.c` `ReadImageFile(flags,…)` to `Image_ReadVTFFile`, so the Patch-21 decode now
actually runs. An `_hdr` face stored as RGBA16F (not RGBS/BGRA8) just loads as native float and ignores the flag (the
decode gate is `vmffmt==VMF_BGRA8`). The Patch-21 `mat_vmt.c` emit stays (harmless; covers genuine UnlitGeneric world
sky-brush materials).

## Patch 23 — VBSP world-surface emit overrun guard (d1_canals team-select RAM-explosion crash)  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `plugins/hl2/mod_vbsp.c` (`VBSP_RecursiveWorldNode` + `VBSP_PrepareFrame` + new `VBSP_EMIT_SURF` macro)  ·  search `nettest`

d1_canals loaded + rendered the team-select overview, then on certain camera angles **RAM ramped ~1GB→10GB in ~1s and
crashed**. That signature = a runaway allocation from **heap corruption**, not a normal segfault. Diagnosed (4-agent
workflow; the new prop/HDR/flag code was independently *exonerated*) to the VBSP world render: `mod->nummodelsurfaces`
is narrowed to `cmodels[0].numsurfaces` (mod_vbsp.c ~4305), so `Mod_Batches` assigns `surf->sbatch` + counts
`maxmeshes` only over THAT range — but the leaf/node walk (`VBSP_RecursiveWorldNode`) emits ANY leaf-marked surface
(validated only vs the LARGER `loadmodel->numsurfaces`). When a camera viewpoint brings an out-of-range surface into a
visible leaf, `surf->sbatch->mesh[surf->sbatch->meshes++]` writes through a NULL/unsized `sbatch` and overruns the
contiguous `bmeshes` block → smashes an adjacent allocation's size header → a later malloc reads it as multi-GB. It is
scene/camera-specific because it only fires when those surfaces enter that angle's PVS leaves.

FIX (crash stopper): a `VBSP_EMIT_SURF(s)` macro replaces all FOUR raw emit sites (leaf walk, node walk, surfvis==NULL
fallback, displacement loop). It writes only when `s->sbatch && s->sbatch->meshes < s->sbatch->maxmeshes*R_MAX_RECURSE`
(the real mesh[] capacity — engine + plugin resolve `R_MAX_RECURSE` from the same `#ifndef`-guarded headers, so they
agree), else drops the surface (never corrupts the heap) and warns the first 8 times at `developer 1`. Plus a load-time
`developer 1` print of `total vs model0(batched)` surface counts to confirm/quantify the gap. NOTE: this is the
definitive crash-stopper; if it drops VISIBLE world surfaces (holes), the follow-up ROOT fix is to widen the world
batch range so every walk-reachable surface gets a batch (set `mod->firstmodelsurface=0` / `nummodelsurfaces=numsurfaces`
for the Batches build) — not applied yet, pending the runtime gap/drop counts.

Rebuilds: engine (`make m-rel`) + hl2 plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc`).

## Patch 24 — ODE trimesh-data leak (the REAL d1_canals 12GB-OOM crash) + brush "no geometry" per-frame spam  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/server/progdefs.h` (+1 field) + `engine/common/com_phys_ode.c`  ·  search `nettest`  ·  also `engine/common/zone.c` (`[bigalloc]` diagnostic)

The d1_canals_03 "RAM spikes to ~12GB super fast, then crash" was NOT props (`sv_props_physics 0` still crashed), NOT
the Patch-23 VBSP overrun (its guard never tripped), and produced NO `[bigalloc]` line — i.e. a flood of sub-256MB
allocations, a leak. Root cause: **ODE leaks the trimesh data of every brush-entity collision geom.** Every SOLID_BSP
entity maps to `GEOMTYPE_TRIMESH` (com_phys_ode.c:2090), so ODE builds a trimesh geom for each brush ent (and the
world). That geom rebuilds whenever mins/maxs/mass/modelindex change (~:2155) — **every frame** for a moving/rotating
brush ent (`func_door_rotating`) or one re-`setmodel`'d by brushsync. Each build does
`dataID = dGeomTriMeshDataCreate()` (:2200, holds the trimesh + BVH) but **`dGeomTriMeshDataDestroy` was never called
anywhere** — `dGeomDestroy` frees the geom, NOT its data — so a fresh dataID (1–50MB) leaked every frame → 12GB in
seconds → OOM. (Confirmed via the `[bigalloc]` tripwire's *silence*: a single >256MB alloc would have printed.)

- **FIX (leak):** added `void *geomdata` to `entityrbe_t` (progdefs.h, after `massbuf`); store it at create
  (`ed->rbe.geomdata = dataID;` after the `dCreateTriMesh`); and in `World_ODE_RemoveFromEntity` (after the
  `dGeomDestroy`) `dGeomTriMeshDataDestroy((dTriMeshDataID)ed->rbe.geomdata)` + null it.
  (`dGeomTriMeshGetTriMeshDataID` is commented-out/unavailable in FTE's ODE bindings, so the dataID must be tracked on
  the entity — can't be fetched back from the geom. `dGeomTriMeshDataDestroy` IS imported, so no new binding needed.)
- **FIX (spam):** the per-frame `entity N (classname func_door_rotating/func_breakable) has no geometry`
  (world.c:2973, dev-1) — these Source brush ents build no faces in FTE so `GenerateCollisionMesh` fails; the failure
  path called `World_ODE_RemoveFromEntity` which reset `rbe.physics=false`, so the `!physics` rebuild condition
  re-fired EVERY frame (re-attempt + re-spam + re-count surfaces). Fix: on no-geometry failure leave `physics=true` +
  `geom=NULL` (mins/maxs/modelindex were just recorded) so it only retries if those change → one attempt per ent.
- **Diagnostic (kept):** `zone.c` BZF_Malloc/Z_Malloc print `[bigalloc] N bytes` for any single alloc >256MB (logged
  BEFORE the malloc so it survives an OOM). Harmless; useful for the next single-giant-alloc.

**Build note:** progdefs.h changes `entityrbe_t`'s size → rebuild ENGINE + PLUGIN together (ABI). Rebuilds: engine
(`make m-rel`) + hl2 plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=hl2 CC=gcc`).

## Patch 25 — the ACTUAL d1_canals_01 OOM: unbounded CSQC entity-array realloc (remote-DoS) + the static-prop mirror flood that triggered it  *(APPLIED)*

**Files:** `engine/client/pr_csqc.c` (`CSQC_EntityCheck` + its 4 call sites — KEEP) · mod-side `nettest/src/server/sv_props.qc` (`Props_SpawnStatic`)  ·  search `nettest`

**This is the real cause.** Patches 17–20 / 23 / 24 each fixed a genuine but *different* d1_canals issue (NULL guards, PVS cull, the ODE trimesh leak) — **none** was the 12–13GB OOM the user kept hitting on **d1_canals_01** (canals_03 stayed ~1GB throughout). Decisive repro: set the menu-backdrop pool (`nettest/data/maps.txt`) to **only `d1_canals_01`**, launch → RAM ramps to ~12GB and crashes in ~25s, screen never renders a frame (blank).

**Diagnosis (the trail every earlier canals patch missed).** The 12GB was NON-zone AND NON-BZ — it bypassed the `[zmem]`/`[bigalloc]` tripwires entirely, because those hook `Z_Malloc`/`BZ_Malloc` but **`BZ_Realloc` is plain `realloc()` — untracked**. A `[realloc]` high-water tripwire added to `BZF_Realloc` then caught it: a **single `BZ_Realloc` of ~34GB** (`32767 MB`). `__builtin_return_address(0)` captured at the `BZ_Realloc` entry, resolved with `addr2line` on the unstripped `release/fteqw64.exe.db` (ASLR defeated via an anchor symbol delta), pinned the caller to **`CSQC_EntityCheck`** (pr_csqc.c) — the CSQC entity array.

**Root cause (engine).** `CSQC_EntityCheck(entnum)` grows the `csqcent[]` pointer array to `entnum × sizeof(ptr)` with **no upper bound**. The CSQC entity-delta wire format reads a 22-bit index as `(entnum & 0x3fff) | (MSG_ReadByte() << 14)`. When a packet is **truncated mid-header** (the 2-byte short reads, the extended-index byte hits EOF), `MSG_ReadByte()` returns **-1** and the `<<14` **sign-extends** into the high bits → `entnum ≈ 0xFFFFFFxx` (~4.29 billion) → `4.29e9 × 8 = ~34GB` `BZ_Realloc` + `memset` (the memset page-touch is what actually balloons RAM) → OOM. **Also a remote-DoS:** any malicious/buggy server can truncate a CSQC entity packet and OOM-crash a connected client.

**Root cause (why d1_canals_01 specifically — a regression from this session's Source-prop feature).** `sv_props.qc Props_SpawnStatic` networked **every `prop_static` as an always-on CSQC entity** (`SendEntity = phys_files_Send` + `pvsflags = PVSF_NOREMOVE` = sent to every client, ignoring PVS). HL2 d1_canals_01 has **thousands** of decorative props (CSQC entnums observed past 8000) → the CSQC entity datagram **overflowed**, truncating mid-entity → the corrupt index. canals_03 / surf maps have few props, so they never overflowed → never tripped it.

**FIX (engine, `pr_csqc.c`):**
- `CSQC_EntityCheck` now returns `qboolean` — **`false` for `entnum > 0x3fffff`** (beyond the 22-bit protocol max = a corrupt/truncated read), refusing the realloc.
- The 4 callers recover **gracefully** instead of `Host_EndGame`: the entity-delta loop (update + remove) `break`s — treats it as end-of-packet, keeping the connection AND the entities that parsed; the two CSQC sound paths `return false` (engine plays the sound normally). A prop-dense map that overflows the CSQC datagram now just renders the entities that fit, instead of OOM-ing or disconnecting to a black screen.

**FIX (mod, `sv_props.qc`):** `Props_SpawnStatic` no longer attaches a per-prop CSQC mirror. Static props don't move, so the engine's standard **PVS-culled** entity networking renders them (modelindex/angles/colormod/alpha all network) at near-zero ongoing cost and scales to thousands. Server `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX` still blocks bullets/grenades/non-predicted moves; the only loss is local predicted-pmove collision on decorative clutter (minor rubber-band). `prop_physics` (few, interactive) keep their mirror. Recompile QC: `fteqcc64_latest.exe progs.src`.

**Cleanup:** the OOM-hunt diagnostics added across this and earlier canals patches were removed afterward — `[bigalloc]`/`[zmem]`/`[realloc]` (zone.c), the `[glwrap]` qglTexImage2D interposer (gl_vidcommon.c), `[gltex]` (gl_draw.c), `[glclamp]`/`[glbuf]` (gl_backend.c), `[lmdbg]` + the unrelated lightmap-atlas cap (gl_model.c), and the `[vtf-hdr]`/`[sky]`/`[vbsp]`-gap dev prints. *(Supersedes Patch 24's "diagnostic kept" note — `[bigalloc]` is gone too.)* The real feature/fix patches (21/22 HDR sky, 24 ODE leak, this one) stay.

Rebuilds: engine `make m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64 CC=gcc` (pr_csqc.c is engine-only; no plugin/ABI change). The mod fix is QC-only.

## Patch 26 — offline map index (fixes missing CS:S maps) + add-only lazy mounting (DEFAULT ON)  *(APPLIED)*

> **STATUS / OUTCOME:** both parts now ship. The **offline map index** lists CS:S/CoD maps correctly in the create-server menu. The **lazy on-demand mounting** is now **DEFAULT ON (`fs_lazyaddons 1`)** and crash-safe, after fixing the original FATAL FLAW. **The fix: `fs_useaddons` is now ADD-ONLY** — it calls `FS_Addon_Mount` per spec (which appends a searchpath at lowest priority and BuildHashes the new files, dup-skipping an already-mounted path) and **never calls `FS_ReloadPackFiles`**. The old crash was the rebuild: `FS_ReloadPackFiles` FREES all old searchpaths (`ClosePath`, fs.c:~5617) while a map/backdrop server holds that content → dangling pointers → access violation on Source-map load and on disconnect-to-backdrop. Add-only never frees, so it is safe to mount mid-map (the always-running backdrop server is fine). Trade-off: games **accumulate** for the session (never unmounted mid-session) — bounded by the 6 configured games; each game's one-time `BuildHash` is paid lazily on first selection. Boot mounts only the small GoldSrc base (valve+cstrike via the backdrop dep-mount); the heavy hl2/CSS `.vpk` + CoD `.iwd` stay lazy until their map is picked → faster boot. **Engine-only change** (no QC change — the menu already issues `fs_useaddons …` then `map …` in the same FIFO buffer; they now ADD instead of rebuild). KNOWN separate issue: same-named maps still shadow by mount priority (cstrike(1.6) outranks CS:S → `cs_assault` loads the GoldSrc version) — fixed by the **package-qualified map load** follow-up (Part 2 in the plan), plus the Source `.mdl` prop crash below.



**Files:** `engine/common/fs.c` (extends the P8 fs_load addon system) · mod-side `nettest/src/menu/m_createserver.qc` + `m_main.qc`  ·  search `nettest (P25)` / `nettest (P26)`

**Two problems, one subsystem (the multi-game filesystem):**
1. **Slow boot.** `fs_addons.txt` lists 6 external games (Half-Life/valve, Half-Life/cstrike=CS1.6, Half-Life 2/hl2, Counter-Strike Source/cstrike=CS:S, CoD1, CoD2). They were ALL mounted + hash-indexed (`BuildHash`, fs.c:4344) serially on the main thread at every searchpath rebuild (`FS_RemountAddons`, fs.c:5641) — a ~0.5–1s boot stall.
2. **Missing CS:S maps in the create-server menu.** CS:S and CS1.6 both mount as the leaf dir `cstrike` and share map names (`de_dust2.bsp`, different BSP formats). With both in one search path the same-named maps **shadow** each other, and the menu classified by `search_getpackagename` which returned the ambiguous `cstrike` for both → CS:S maps mis-bucketed as CS1.6 → absent from the CS:S tab.

**Approach: lazy-mount.** Don't mount the games at boot; cheaply *index* their maps (loose `.bsp`/`.d3dbsp` files → a directory read needs no mount); mount a game only when one of its maps is loaded. Because each game is enumerated separately, same-named maps become distinct, correctly-tagged entries — fixing #2 for free.

**Engine (`fs.c`):**
- **`fs_lazyaddons`** cvar (default `1`; `0` = old eager mount-all-at-boot, escape hatch).
- **`FS_IndexAddonMaps()` / `fs_indexmaps`** — writes `data/maps_index.txt`, one `"<sourcespec>\t<mapname>"` line per map. The mod's own maps come from `FS_EnumerateNonAddonFiles` (a `COM_EnumerateFiles` variant that SKIPS `SPF_ADDON` paths so an already-mounted game can't mis-tag them); each addon game's maps come from `Sys_EnumerateFiles("<FS_Addon_Resolve(spec)>/maps", "*.bsp"/"*.d3dbsp")` — OFFLINE, no mount, no BuildHash. Not installed → resolve fails → game silently skipped.
- **`fs_useaddons <spec> [<spec> …]`** — **ADD-ONLY**: for each spec, `FS_Addon_Mount(spec, ~0u)` (resolves steam:/abs/rel, dup-skips an already-mounted path, appends at LOWEST priority, BuildHashes the new files), under `fs_thread_mutex` (the hash add is the Unsafe/no-internal-lock variant). **No `fs_activeaddons`, no clear, no `FS_ReloadPackFiles`** — so it never frees searchpaths and is crash-safe while a map is loaded. Games accumulate for the session. Run right before `map` (same command buffer, FIFO). No-op in eager mode (`fs_lazyaddons 0`).
- **Gate** (`FS_ReloadPackFilesFlags`, fs.c:~5650): a genuine rebuild (`fs_restart`/gamedir switch) always calls `FS_RemountAddons()` — re-mounting every persisted `fs_addons.txt` game (add-only at tail) so the user's games survive a restart. There is NO lazy branch / `FS_MountActiveAddons` anymore; on-demand mounting is exclusively the add-only `FS_UseAddons_f` path. The mod's own gamedir + FTE base are unaffected (they load via the normal gamedir path, not fs_addons.txt).

**Menu:** `create_server_read_index(filter)` reads `data/maps_index.txt` (replacing the `search_begin` scan), classifying each map by its true source spec via the existing `create_server_map_game()` (now reliable: `"…Counter-Strike Source/cstrike"`→CS:S, `"…Half-Life/cstrike"`→CS1.6). `create_server_launch` calls `create_server_mount_for_map(map, filter)` → `fs_useaddons <deps>` before `map`. **Dep sets = an always-mounted BASE (`valve` + `cstrike`) + the map's own game added on top** — because the mod currently borrows gameplay/map assets from Half-Life + CS 1.6, so EVERY map (nettest's own included) needs them. CS:S → base + `hl2` + CS:S-cstrike; HL2 → base + `hl2`; CoD → base + that CoD dir; CS1.6/HL/nettest → base only. (An earlier EXCLUSIVE per-game mount was the bug: dropping valve/cstrike for a CS:S/HL2/CoD map stripped the mod itself → "maps that worked before stop working" + missing assets on nettest maps. Set `base` to `""` in `create_server_deps_for_spec` once nettest is fully self-contained → then it's truly lazy.) `m_main.qc m_init` issues `fs_indexmaps` at boot; the backdrop dep-mounts the base (so boot mounts only the small GoldSrc valve+cstrike, with the heavy hl2/CSS .vpk + CoD .iwd staying lazy until their maps are picked).

**SHADOWING (was a KNOWN LIMITATION, now FIXED by Part 2 below):** mount priority means a same-named map loads the highest-priority copy — nettest (the mod) outranks the base, and the base CS1.6 `cstrike` outranks CS:S. So `map de_dust2` loaded nettest's, and `map cs_assault` loaded the CS1.6 GoldSrc one, never the CS:S VBSP. **Part 2** adds a package-qualified map load so the create-server menu can pick a SPECIFIC game's copy.

**Tradeoff (intended):** the first selection of each game pays its one-time `BuildHash` (~0.5–1s), moved off boot onto first-use. With add-only mounting a game also stays mounted for the rest of the session (no unmount), so a second different-game selection just adds; memory is bounded by the 6 configured games.

Rebuilds: engine `make m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64 CC=gcc` (Part 1 is **engine-only**, no QC rebuild — the menu already emits `fs_useaddons … ` then `map …`). Verify: cold boot faster, `path` shows only valve+cstrike mounted; selecting a CS:S/HL2 map mounts+hashes that game then loads with **no access violation**; **disconnect back to the backdrop no longer crashes** (the rebuild that used to dangle content is gone); repeated cross-game selections accumulate without crashing; `fs_restart` remounts all games.

**Follow-ups (post-review + user testing):**
- **Archived maps (CoD).** `FS_IndexAddonMaps` first only readdir'd LOOSE `maps/` files, so CoD maps (which live inside `.iwd`/`.pk3` zips — `iw_00.iwd`…) went un-indexed (a regression vs the old eager mount that read inside them). Fixed with `FS_IndexArchive_Visit`: per game dir, `Sys_EnumerateFiles` the `*.iwd`/`*.pk3`/`*.pk4`/`*.pak` archives, `FS_OpenPackByExtension` each (central-directory read only, NO mount/BuildHash), enumerate its `maps/*.bsp`+`*.d3dbsp`, `ClosePath`. Now 33 CoD1 + 39 CoD2 maps index (gid 4/5). `.iwd` is the base zip loader (fs.c:8926), no plugin needed.
- **Add-only conversion (the crash fix, supersedes the old rebuild design).** The original `fs_useaddons` did `FS_ReloadPackFiles` (full rebuild: free all searchpaths + re-add) to make EXACTLY the requested set active — which dangled loaded content mid-map and crashed. Replaced with pure ADD-ONLY `FS_Addon_Mount` per spec (no free, no rebuild). Consequence: the old "clear the previous game" / "no-op when the set is unchanged" logic is **gone** (there is no active-set to swap; games just accumulate). The menu's bare-`fs_useaddons`-to-clear for nettest maps is now a harmless no-op (nothing to clear). Shadowing of same-named maps is no longer "fixed" by exclusivity (it never safely was) — it is handled by the package-qualified map load (Part 2).
- **KNOWN ISSUE (separate, NOT lazy-mount):** prop-heavy CS:S/HL2 maps (e.g. `cs_assault`) crash in the Source `.mdl` loader (`models/props_lab/pipesystem02a.mdl` "Unable to load / no collision info" → access violation). Pre-existing in the Source-prop feature, only newly *reachable* because those maps now list. Lighter CS:S maps load fine. Needs its own reproduce + `.db` addr2line crash-hunt.

### Patch 26 **Part 2** — package-qualified map load (load a SPECIFIC game's copy of a same-named map)  *(APPLIED)*

**Problem:** `cs_assault.bsp` / `de_dust2.bsp` exist in several mounted games; `FS_FLocateFile` (fs.c:~2176) takes the FIRST (highest-priority) searchpath hit, so the CS:S VBSP can never load while the CS1.6 GoldSrc copy (or nettest's) outranks it. **Fix:** a `map "@<gamespec>/<mapname>"` qualifier biases ONLY the worldmodel BSP locate to one game's resolved dir — no searchpath reorder, no rebuild (crash-safe, composes with Part 1).

**Files / search `nettest (P26 Part 2)`:**
- **fs.c** — global `char fs_preferhint[MAX_OSPATH]` (the resolved game dir to prefer; "" = off). In `FS_FLocateFile`: the `com_fs_cache` fast-path gains `&& !*fs_preferhint` (a set hint must bypass the cache, since the hash keeps only the highest-priority hit per name — the exact copy we want to override); a NEW **preferred pass** runs before the pure/main loops — it iterates `com_searchpaths` and `FindFile`s only in searchpaths whose `logicalpath` matches the hint **at a path boundary** (`Q_strcasestr` + the next char must be `/`,`\` or end — so `.../Call of Duty` can't match `.../Call of Duty 2`); on a miss it leaves `found==FF_NOTFOUND` so the normal loops run as the fallback (empty-hint path is byte-identical to before). `FS_SetPreferHint(spec)` resolves a game spec via the SAME `FS_Addon_Resolve` that produced each addon's `logicalpath` (so the match is exact); `FS_ClearPreferHint()`.
- **common.h** — declares `FS_SetPreferHint`/`FS_ClearPreferHint` (next to `FS_FLocateFile`; NOT fs.h — sv_init.c includes common.h, not fs.h).
- **sv_ccmds.c** `SV_Map_f` — global `char sv_mappreferhint[MAX_OSPATH]`, cleared at function entry (so `map_restart`/`changelevel`/savegame paths that skip the parse can't inherit a stale hint). The package-manager `:` parse skips args starting with `@`. The `@<spec>/<map>` arg (always QUOTED by the menu → one token) is split on the **LAST** `/` (the spec itself contains `/` and `:`): tag→`sv_mappreferhint`, bare mapname→`level` (so all downstream existence checks + `sv.modelname` use the bare name).
- **sv_init.c** `SV_SpawnServer` — brackets ONLY the worldmodel `Mod_ForName(sv.modelname, MLV_ERROR)` (which blocks until loaded, even on a loader thread): `FS_SetPreferHint(sv_mappreferhint)` then immediately `sv_mappreferhint[0]=0` (one-shot consume — can't leak to a later cache-hit/savegame spawn); `FS_ClearPreferHint()` after the load + the consistent mtime-reload. Scoped to the `.bsp` only, so precache + the mod's own same-named content are NOT biased.
- **m_createserver.qc** `create_server_launch` — on a specific game tab (`create_server_game_filter != 0`) with a known source spec, emits `map "@<spec>/<mapname>"`; the All tab + unqualified paths keep plain `map %s`. Mount step (`fs_useaddons`, Part 1) unchanged — both games may be mounted; the hint disambiguates.

**Adversarially reviewed** (multi-agent find→verify): fixed a `map_restart` stale-hint leak + a savegame-cache-hit leak (entry-clear + one-shot consume) and added the path-boundary match. Rejected a false "mtime-reload double-bias" finding — the reload intentionally reuses the same preferred copy.

**Verify:** on the CS:S tab, Start `cs_assault` (or `de_dust2`) → loads the Source VBSP, not the GoldSrc/nettest copy (confirm in-world or `flocate maps/cs_assault.bsp` shows the CS:S logicalpath). Console `map "@steam:Counter-Strike Source/cstrike/cs_assault"` works directly. All-tab + non-shared maps + `map_restart` behave exactly as before. Rebuild: engine `make m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64 CC=gcc` + menu `fteqcc64_latest.exe m_progs.src`.

## Patch 27 — multiplayer connect crash: flush the FS hash on EVERY pack rebuild  *(APPLIED, engine-only)*

**Symptom (the "scary" one):** a second client connecting to a listen server — or any client connecting to the dedicated server — **crashed instantly, no RAM spike, no error** (the server just logged `Client removed` / `timed out`). Pre-existing (not caused by the lazy-mount work; reproduced with `fs_lazyaddons 0` too).

**Root cause:** `FS_ReloadPackFilesFlags` ([fs.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\fs.c) ~5683) only flushed the `filesystemhash` when the searchpath *order* changed (`if (next || i != orderkey)`). A connect triggers a `COM_Gamedir` reload that **closes + reopens the same packs without reordering them**, so the flush was skipped — but `FS_ReloadPackFilesFlags` had still freed the old `searchpath_t`s, leaving the hash full of **dangling pack-bucket pointers**. The next `FS_AddFileHashUnsafe` / lookup walked freed memory → access violation deep in the connect path (which is why it surfaced on the *connecting* client, not the server).

**Fix (one condition):** flush the hash whenever the pack set is rebuilt at all, not just on reorder:
```c
//nettest: was `if (next || i != orderkey)`.  A COM_Gamedir reload (e.g. on connect) re-opens the SAME packs
//without reordering, so the old test skipped the flush while the searchpaths were freed underneath the hash
//-> dangling pack buckets -> crash. Flush on ANY rebuild (reloadflags set) too.
if (next || i != orderkey || reloadflags)
```
**Verify (done):** two GL clients on a listen server, and a GL client → dedicated server, both connect and STAY connected; `crashaddr.txt` stays empty. Holds for `fs_lazyaddons` 1 (default) and 0.

---

## Patch 28 — `cl_launchintogame`: `+connect` / `+map` / demo launch options bypass the menu backdrop  *(APPLIED, engine + 1 QC line)*

**Why:** the menu loads a local "backdrop" listen server in `m_init` (`map <cl_menumap>`). That `map` ran from `m_init` and **clobbered any command-line `+connect <ip>` / `+map <name>`**, so launching the game with those options always dumped the user on the menu world instead of the server/map they asked for.

**Mechanism:** a new engine cvar tells the menu the launch intent.
- **[cl_main.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\client\cl_main.c)** — `cvar_t cl_launchintogame = CVARFD("cl_launchintogame","0", CVAR_NOSAVE|CVAR_NORESET, …)`. In **`Host_Init`, immediately before `M_Init()`** (which is where the menu's `m_init` runs — and `M_Init` is *before* `CL_Init`), register it and `Cvar_ForceSet` it to `"1"` iff the command line has any of `+connect/+map/+spmap/+devmap/+gamemap/+changelevel/+playdemo/+demo/+qtvplay`.
- **[m_main.qc](c:\FTEQuake\nettest\src\menu\m_main.qc)** `m_init` — gate the backdrop on it: `if (menumap != "" && menumap != "none" && cvar("cl_launchintogame") == 0) Menu_StartBackdrop(menumap);` (backdrop logic was lifted into a `Menu_StartBackdrop(menumap)` helper).

**THE two traps that made this hard (both essential):**
1. **`CVAR_NORESET` is mandatory.** `Cvar_GamedirChange()` ([cvar.c:602](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\cvar.c#L602)) runs as the fs mounts the game during boot and **resets every registered cvar to its engine default BEFORE `m_init` reads it** — so without `NORESET` the value was silently wiped back to `0` (the symptom: `m_init` always saw `0`). `NORESET` makes `Cvar_GamedirChange` skip it (line 610). Do **not** try to fix this via `Cvar_SetEngineDefault` — its `Z_Free(enginevalue)` corrupts the heap (0xC0000374) because a `CVARFD` cvar's `enginevalue` is the literal default string, not heap.
2. **Set it before `M_Init`, not in `CL_Init`.** The menu's `m_init` runs inside `M_Init()` (Host_Init:~8071), which is BEFORE `CL_Init()` (~8077). Registering the cvar in `CL_Init` is too late — `m_init` has already read it.

**Console shorthand still works** independently: `map @<spec>/<name>` and the `mapfrom`/`css`/`hl`/`cod` aliases (Patch 26 Part 2) are unaffected.

**Verify (done):** with the dedicated server up, `fteqw64.exe … +connect 127.0.0.1:27500` connects straight in (no `Server spawned` backdrop) across repeated runs; `+map 2fort` boots straight into 2fort; a plain launch still loads the backdrop. No crash, no debug output.

---

## Diagnostic: vectored crash-address logger (kept)  *(APPLIED, engine-only)*

The mingw release build has **no crash handler** (`CATCHCRASH` is debug-only; no minidump). `nettest_CrashAddrLogger` in [sys_win.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\client\sys_win.c) (an `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`, registered unconditionally) writes `code/addr/base/rva` + a 28-frame `CaptureStackBackTrace` to `C:\FTEQuake\nettest\crashaddr.txt` via raw Win32 `CreateFileA` (bypassing the `fopen_nolink` sandbox) on a fatal exception, then `EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_SEARCH`. Resolve with `addr2line -e fteqw64.exe.db -f -C -i (0x140000000 + rva)`. NOTE: it catches access-violations etc. but NOT heap-corruption aborts (`0xC0000374`), which don't dispatch through the VEH.

---

## Patch 29 — don't advertise SPF_ADDON game-mounts to clients (the `dlcache absolute path` MP-join break)  *(APPLIED, engine-only)*

**Symptom:** a client connecting to a dedicated server that has external games mounted (HL2 / CS:S / CoD via `fs_addons.txt`) connects fine, then **loops forever re-mounting the addon vpkfiles and spamming `Error: absolute path in filename C:/dlcache/games/call.<hash>`** (fs.c:2648), never spawning into the map.

**Root cause:** `FS_GetPackHashes` ([fs.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\fs.c) ~2511) and `FS_GetPackNames` (~2544) build the server's advertised package list (`//paks` / `//paknames`, sv_user.c) by iterating `com_searchpaths` with only a `crc_check` guard — **no `SPF_ADDON` filter**. The addon game-mounts carry **absolute** Steam/CoD `purepath`s (e.g. `C:/games/Call of Duty/Main/...`), so the client feeds them to `FS_GenCachedPakName` → `C:/dlcache/games/call.<hash>`, which `FS_GetCleanPath` rejects (absolute-path sandbox), and the `//paks` re-validation re-fires every message → infinite loop. `SPF_ADDON` ([fs.h:134](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\fs.h#L134)) is explicitly documented "no pure/server semantics"; `FS_EnumerateNonAddonFiles` already filters them the same way.

**Fix (two one-liners):** in the non-pure `else` branches of both functions, change `if (search->crc_check)` → `if (search->crc_check && !(search->flags & SPF_ADDON))`. Addon mounts are now invisible to clients; the server still uses them locally for map content.

**Verify (done):** with the fix, the `absolute path` error is gone and the client downloads only the csprogs + real assets. **THIS is the fix that made MP work** — the user had been running the OLD server build which lacked it (see the two-install note in memory).

---

## Patch 30 — csprogs download deadlock → self-heal + clear error  *(APPLIED, engine-only)*

**Symptom (cost hours of confusion):** client connects, "downloads" csprogs (file written fully to disk), then **deadlocks forever with no map** — most often because the dedicated server was running a **different csprogs build** than the client (recompile-without-restart), or a **stale/bloated cached** `csprogsvers/<hash>.dat` (e.g. accumulated from earlier retry-appends).

**Root cause:** in `CL_LoadModels` ([cl_parse.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\client\cl_parse.c) ~1294-1304), when `CSQC_CheckDownload` fails but the `csprogsvers/<hash>.dat` file is already on disk, `CL_CheckOrEnqueDownloadFile(..., DLLF_REQUIRED)` returns true (file present, won't re-pull without `DLLF_OVERWRITE`) → `return -1` every frame → `cl.contentstage` never advances → silent hang.

**Fix:** after `CL_IsDownloading` is false, if `CL_CheckDLFile(str)` shows the file present-but-still-invalid: force ONE clean re-download (`FS_Remove` the stale file + re-enqueue with `DLLF_REQUIRED|DLLF_OVERWRITE`); if the fresh copy STILL fails to validate (tracked by a hash-keyed static so it can't loop), `Host_EndGame("csprogs checksum mismatch … rebuild + RESTART the dedicated server …")`. Converts a silent deadlock into either auto-recovery or an actionable error. Failure-path only — never runs on a successful join.

**Note:** a single-machine "dedicated server + client from the SAME gamedir" self-test shows a csprogs self-download that doesn't finalize — that's a TEST-HARNESS artifact, NOT a real bug; real two-party joins work (verified by the user: connected, joined, shot, bought, chatted).

---

## Patch 31 — host Source/VBSP (+ CoD) maps on a DEDICATED server (headless plugin + ODE collision crash)  *(APPLIED, plugins + engine)*

**Symptom:** the dedicated server (`fteqwsv64.exe`) loaded GoldSrc (CS1.6) + nettest maps fine, but **crashed ~1s after** `+mapfrom css de_dust2` (`0xC0000005`), and would crash identically on CoD maps. The `hl2: TTH/VTF/VMT support unavailable` / `cod: Shader Types/IWI support unavailable` banners at boot are the SAME headless condition surfacing *gracefully* — only the map-load path forgot to check it.

There were **TWO independent crashes** stacked on the same map load:

**Crash #1 — the loader plugins' renderer-only material pass (plugin fix).** `fteplug_hl2_x64.dll` / `fteplug_cod_x64.dll` are single DLLs built WITH `HAVE_CLIENT` (`plugins/Makefile:512` passes neither `-DSERVERONLY` nor `-DCLIENTONLY`), so their material/lightmap pass is compiled in. They hardcode `qrenderer = QR_OPENGL` and never set `QR_NONE` headless, so `if (qrenderer != QR_NONE)` stayed true and the pass ran — calling `modfuncs->RegisterBasicShader` / `modfuncs->Batches_Build`, which a SERVERONLY engine leaves **NULL** (`engine/common/plugin.c:2424-2433`, inside `#ifdef HAVE_CLIENT … #else NULL,NULL`). Call-through-NULL → crash. (Collision is safe: `BIH_Build` is non-NULL on the server, `plugin.c:2421`, unconditional.)
- **[mod_vbsp.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\plugins\hl2\mod_vbsp.c)** `VBSP_Init` (~4413, after the interface fetches): `if (!plugfuncs->GetEngineInterface(plugimagefuncs_name, sizeof(plugimagefuncs_t))) qrenderer = QR_NONE;` — the exact NULL-interface probe `VTF_Init` already uses (`img_vtf.c:288`). Non-NULL on the client → keeps `QR_OPENGL`. The file-global `qrenderer` (~59) then makes every existing gate (`qrenderer != QR_NONE` at the world + submodel material pass ~4327/4381; `haverenderer` lighting) skip correctly. No other gating edits needed (the load funcs + BIH are server-safe and keep running).
- **[codbsp.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\plugins\cod\codbsp.c)** had NO `qrenderer` global and its gate was **commented out** (`:1845`), so `CODBSP_GenerateMaterials` ran unconditionally. Added `r_qrenderer_t qrenderer = QR_OPENGL;` (~13), the **identical probe** in `CODBSP_Init` (~2010), and **uncommented** `if (qrenderer != QR_NONE)` (1845).

**Crash #2 — the engine building the ODE world-collision mesh (engine fix).** With crash #1 gone, the map still crashed when `fteplug_ode_x64.dll` built the world collision mesh. `World_GenerateCollisionMesh` → `GenerateCollisionMesh_BSP` ([server/world.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\server\world.c) ~2941) walks `mod->surfaces[].mesh`. On a **headless VBSP** world, `surf->mesh` is ALLOCATED but UNFILLED (`xyz_array == NULL`) because the renderer's `Batches_Build` that fills it is skipped on a dedicated server — so the fill loop dereferenced a NULL `xyz_array`. (Q1/GoldSrc don't hit this: their `surf->mesh` is NULL on a dedicated server, so they already take the edge-path `else`.)
- **Fix:** both the count loop (~2963) and the fill loop (~2991) guard changed `if (surf->mesh)` → **`if (surf->mesh && surf->mesh->xyz_array)`**, so headless VBSP falls through to the same edge/box-hull `else` branch Q1 uses on a dedicated server. No-op on the client/listen server (renderer present → `xyz_array` filled → uses the mesh exactly as before).

**Located via** the dedicated-server crash logger (the dedi `main` has no crash handler — added `AddVectoredExceptionHandler(1, nettest_CrashAddrLogger)` in [sv_sys_win.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\server\sv_sys_win.c):1718, a server-side parallel to the client's kept `nettest_CrashAddrLogger` — `crashaddr.txt` gave `mod=fteqwsv64.exe+0x849d6` with `fteplug_ode_x64.dll` in the frames; `addr2line` → `GenerateCollisionMesh_BSP`). Kept (release dedi otherwise dies silently).

**Build / deploy:** plugins `release/fteplug_hl2_x64.dll` + `fteplug_cod_x64.dll` (built directly with the engine's `BASE_CFLAGS`; `make plugins-rel` can't be used — its `native:` target builds the ffmpeg plugin first, which needs `unzip`); engine `sv-rel` (the world.c fix). **Deploy** both DLLs + `fteqwsv64.exe` → `C:\FTEQuake\`. The client `fteqw64.exe` (`m-rel`) does NOT need rebuilding for the world.c guard (no-op with a renderer) but DOES use the new plugins.

**Verify (done):** `fteqwsv64.exe -game nettest +mapfrom css de_dust2` stays alive (no crash; `crashaddr.txt` empty); a client connecting confirms the server IS on de_dust2 (`Map model file does not match (maps/de_dust2.bsp), 0XE0B39589 != 0/0`). Before these fixes it exited instantly.

**Follow-on (FIXED by Patch 32 below):** a connecting client got `Map model file does not match … kicked due to the file … being modified` — the worldmodel-CRC consistency check. The server loaded the CS:S map (via the Patch-26-Part-2 `@spec` prefer-hint) but the connecting client resolved a *different* same-named copy (the GoldSrc one), so the CRCs differed. The prefer-hint was server-spawn-only; Patch 32 propagates it to the client.

---

## Patch 32 — propagate the map prefer-hint to the connecting client (same-named map kick on connect)  *(APPLIED, engine-only)*

**Symptom:** with Patch 31 (dedi hosts Source maps), a client connecting to a dedicated server hosting a **same-named** map — `cs_assault` / `de_dust2` exist in BOTH Counter-Strike:Source (VBSP) and CS1.6/Half-Life (GoldSrc) — was **kicked at the map-check** and bounced to a grey menu, retrying forever: `Map model file does not match (maps/cs_assault.bsp), 0XAD2FC871 != 0/0` … `kicked due to the file … being modfied, located at …/Half-Life/cstrike/maps/cs_assault.bsp`. A map *unique* to one game joined fine.

**Root cause:** the Patch-26-Part-2 prefer-hint (`map @<spec>/<map>` → `FS_SetPreferHint`) was **server-spawn-only**. The server loaded the CS:S copy; the connecting client had no hint, so its connect-time worldmodel load resolved the **highest-priority** same-named copy — the GoldSrc `Half-Life/cstrike` one. Decoding the kick (`SV_PreSpawn_f`, [sv_user.c:2013-2030](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\server\sv_user.c#L2013), format is `clientCRC != serverCRC/CRC2`): client's GoldSrc worldmodel = `0xAD2FC871`, server's VBSP worldmodel = `0`. **Checksum insight:** the VBSP/CoD worldmodel checksum is computed identically on client AND server (`VBSP_ComputeChecksum`, [mod_vbsp.c:4400](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\plugins\hl2\mod_vbsp.c#L4400), *outside* the `qrenderer!=QR_NONE` gate; CoD sets none → 0), so loading the **same** physical copy yields matching checksums → `check != worldmodel->checksum` is `X==X` → **no kick**. The kick only fired because the client loaded a *different-format* (GoldSrc, engine-checksummed) copy. So the entire fix is "make the client load the same copy" — no checksum/security weakening.

**Fix (two ends, both reusing the existing `FS_SetPreferHint`/`FS_FLocateFile` preferred-pass):**
- **Server** — [sv_init.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\server\sv_init.c) `SV_SpawnServer`: a function-scope `char mappref_spec[MAX_OSPATH]=""` captures `sv_mappreferhint` (via `Q_strncpyz`) **before** the existing prefer-hint block zeroes the one-shot global, then advertises it as a new `*mappref` serverinfo star-key — `InfoBuf_SetStarKey(&svs.info, "*mappref", mappref_spec)` — right after the `*bspversion`/`*startspot` keys. Set **unconditionally** (`""` for plain/non-`@` maps) so it can't carry a stale value across maps. `*`-keys ride the `fullserverinfo` stufftext to every client (sv_user.c PRESPAWN_SERVERINFO, `prioritykeys` includes `"*"`). The capture buffer is at **function scope**, NOT inside the worldmodel-load `else`/prefer-hint blocks (those close before the star-key block runs).
- **Client** — [cl_parse.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\client\cl_parse.c) `CL_ParseModellist`: read `*mappref` from `cl.serverinfo` and `FS_SetPreferHint` it around the worldmodel load, `FS_ClearPreferHint` after.

**THE non-obvious gotcha (cost most of the debugging):** the worldmodel load is **asynchronous** — dispatched to a `WG_LOADER` worker thread (`Mod_LoadModel`, gl_model.c). The *first* load wins: the **"we might as well START loading them now"** pre-load loop (~cl_parse.c:4697, `Mod_ForName(…, MLV_SILENT)`) kicks off the worldmodel (index 1) load **before** the obvious load site lower down — and `MLV_SILENT` does **not** block, so a `FS_SetPreferHint`→`Mod_ForName`→`FS_ClearPreferHint` wrapper on the main thread **clears the global `fs_preferhint` before the worker thread performs the locate** (proven by a debug print: `FS_SetPreferHint` resolved correctly, but the `FS_FLocateFile` preferred-pass never saw a non-empty hint). A later hinted load is also too late — the model is already `MLS_LOADING`, so it just waits on the unhinted one. **Fix:** wrap the **index-1 pre-load** with the hint and use **`MLV_SILENTSYNC`** (blocks via `COM_WorkerPartialSync` until the loader thread finishes), so the global hint stays set across the whole worker locate; clear immediately after. The lower hinted load is kept as the **no-`WG_LOADER`-workers fallback** (then it's the worldmodel's first + only load). Since index 1 is the first model in the list, no other model load is in flight during its `SILENTSYNC` window, so the hint can't bleed onto sibling models; it *does* (correctly) cover the worldmodel's own embedded `materials/*`/`vmt/*` deps, which should come from the map's game.

**Timing (why the key is present in time):** serverinfo is sent in `PRESPAWN_SERVERINFO` (prespawn stage ~2) and processed **inline** on the client (`CL_ParseStuffCmd` → `InfoBuf_FromString(&cl.serverinfo,…)`, sets `cl.haveserverinfo`); the modellist is a **later** stage (`PRESPAWN_MODELLIST` ~6). Reliable, in-order delivery + inline processing ⇒ `cl.serverinfo["*mappref"]` is populated before the worldmodel loads. (A workflow adversarial-review lens flagged a theoretical packet-reorder race; ruled out — reliable messages are not reordered, and the stages are strictly sequential.)

**Build/deploy:** engine `m-rel` (client: cl_parse.c) + `sv-rel` (server: sv_init.c); `fs.c`/`sv_init.c` compile into both. Plugins **unchanged** (the checksum symmetry means no plugin rebuild). Deploy `fteqw64.exe` + `fteqwsv64.exe`.

**Verify (done):** dedicated server `+mapfrom css cs_assault`; a connecting client loads `maps/cs_assault.bsp` from the **CS:S** searchpath (the preferred-pass matches `…/Counter-Strike Source/cstrike` + its vpk, rejects `…/Half-Life/cstrike`), **no map-check kick** (was an instant kick→retry loop before), and proceeds to content download. Regression: a plain Q1 `2fort` connect is unaffected (empty `*mappref` ⇒ `FS_SetPreferHint` not called ⇒ byte-identical to before). The single-machine self-connect still stalls later on the csprogs self-download (harness artifact, see Patch 30) — but the kick is gone, which is the fix.

## Patch 33 — CoD map "hang on load": each submodel re-registered ALL the map's shaders  *(APPLIED, cod plugin)*

**Symptom:** connecting to a dedicated server hosting a **CoD1** map (e.g. `+cod dam`) — the client shows the map loading screen, then **hangs** for ~2-3 minutes (the dedicated server `times out` the still-loading client). CoD single-player maps like `dam` have ~150 inline brushmodel submodels (doors / script brushmodels / triggers).

**Root cause (O(textures × submodels) shader registration):** in [codbsp.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\plugins\cod\codbsp.c) `CODBSP_LoadInlineModels`, the per-model material pass is dispatched with a **hardcoded `0`** as the inline-model index:
```c
threadfuncs->AddWork(WG_MAIN, CODBSP_GenerateMaterials, mod, bd, 0, 0);   // <-- bug: 0, should be i
```
`CODBSP_GenerateMaterials` uses that index to gate the "register every one of the map's shaders" loop to the worldmodel only — `if (!a) for(a=0;a<mod->numtextures;a++) RegisterBasicShader(...)` — with the comment *"submodels share textures, so only do this if 'a' is 0 (inline index, 0 = world)."* But because the dispatch always passed `0`, `if (!a)` was true for **every** submodel; and since each submodel is `*mod = *wmod` (so `mod->numtextures` = the **whole map's** texture count), all ~150 submodels re-registered the **entire** shader set. For `dam` that's hundreds of shaders × ~150 submodels ≈ tens of thousands of `RegisterBasicShader` calls ≈ ~0.4s/submodel ≈ a minute-plus of redundant work on the main thread while the connect is blocked → the "hang". (The hl2/VBSP plugin gets this right — `VBSP_LoadModel` passes the real index `i` to `VBSP_GenerateMaterials`.)

**Fix (one char):** pass the loop index `i` instead of `0`, so only the worldmodel (`i==0`) registers shaders and the ~150 submodels skip it:
```c
threadfuncs->AddWork(WG_MAIN, CODBSP_GenerateMaterials, mod, bd, i, 0);
```

**Diagnosis path (kept as a lesson):** the client spun at 100% CPU with steadily growing RAM and a frozen log → instrumented `CODBSP_LoadInlineModels`/`CODBSP_BuildBIH` with sparse prints (every Con_Printf from a loader thread itself queues `WG_MAIN` work, so dense prints distort the timing — keep them sparse). Trace showed the worldmodel BIH is *instant* (36270 leaves), every submodel BIH is instant (1 leaf), but ~0.4s elapsed *between* submodels. Timed the engine per-model callbacks (`Surf_BuildModelLightmaps`, `P_LoadedModel` via `Sys_DoubleTime`) — both fast — leaving the plugin's material pass as the only remaining per-submodel `WG_MAIN` work, where the hardcoded-index bug was. gdb is unusable on this box (attach → exit 57; `gdb.exe` itself fails `0xC0000139` entrypoint-not-found), so all of this was print/timer instrumentation, since removed.

**Verify (done):** `+cod dam` then connect — the inline-model load drops from ~150s (hang, client timed out) to **submodels processing in <1s** (worldmodel shader pass ~10s one-time), RAM **plateaus** at ~1GB (same as any map on this DIAG csprogs build — NOT a CoD leak; a plain `2fort` connect hits the same ~1GB) instead of growing for minutes. Build: cod plugin only (`release/fteplug_cod_x64.dll` via the BASE_CFLAGS-extract method, deploy to `C:\FTEQuake`). The single-machine self-connect still can't confirm the final spawn (csprogs self-connect harness artifact, Patch 30) — but the load-time hang, which is the CoD-specific bug, is fixed.

## Patch 34 — connect-time see-through water + install polish (flushshaders, conhistory, ODE static)  *(APPLIED, engine + cod-unrelated)*

Four related fixes from a polish pass. The headline one:

### 34a — water renders see-through on a CONNECT until a manual cvar nudge  *(engine, client)*
**Symptom:** connecting to a server (esp. Source/CoD maps), water surfaces show their geometric ripple/warp but no opaque texture — you see straight through to the world below. On a LISTEN server the same map's water is fine. Changing `r_wateralpha` to ANY value (even 0), or typing the (now-real) `flushshaders`, makes it "pop in" correctly.

**Root cause:** `Shader_DoReload` ([gl_shader.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\gl\gl_shader.c) ~8467) early-returns while `cls.state < ca_active` (`if (cls.state && cls.state < ca_active) return;`). On a CONNECT the client sits at `ca_onserver` while it loads — so the water shader, built during that phase, is finalized in its stale/fallback state and every `Shader_DoReload` (per-frame, `Surf_NewMap`, the mod's CSQC `flushshaders` in `CSQC_WorldLoaded`) is a no-op. A LISTEN server skips `ca_onserver` (straight to `ca_active`), so its reloads run and the water is correct. A `CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM` change (`r_wateralpha`, [cvar.c:996](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\cvar.c#L996)) → `Shader_NeedReload(false)` → next-frame `Shader_DoReload` → `Shader_Regenerate`→`Shader_DefaultBSPWater` rebuilds it — which is why the manual nudge works, but only because the user does it AFTER the first frame (post-`ca_active`).

**Fix:** a one-shot in [cl_main.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\client\cl_main.c) `CL_Frame`, right after `SCR_UpdateScreen()` draws a frame: when `cls.state==ca_active`, the worldmodel is `MLS_LOADED`, and we haven't already fired for this map, call `Shader_NeedReload(false)` once and record `cl.servercount`. The next frame's `Shader_DoReload` (top of `GLSCR_UpdateScreen`, before the world is drawn) rebuilds the water → corrected from that frame on (≤1 frame of stale water, imperceptible). The marker `cls.shader_reload_servercount` lives in `client_static_t` (persists across the per-signon `cl` wipe), is `-1`-initialized in `CL_Init`, reset in `CL_Disconnect` (so a reconnect to the same unchanged map re-fires), and re-arms automatically per map since `cl.servercount` is fresh per signon. One harmless extra reload per map on listen/demo (one-shot, not per-frame). Found via a multi-agent investigation; the adversarial pass confirmed timing (fires after the shader is built) and edge cases. **VERIFIED by the user.**

### 34b — real `flushshaders` command  *(engine, renderer.c)*
The mod's CSQC runs `flushshaders` on map load (client/cl_sprays.qc, to re-parse freshly-written custom-spray shader files) — but it was never an engine command (`Unknown command "flushshaders"`, a silent no-op). Added `R_FlushShaders_f` → `Shader_NeedReload(true)` and registered it in `Renderer_Init` (next to `vid_reload`). Fixes spray refresh; was also the first (insufficient, mistimed) attempt at the water fix — see 34a for why a map-load-time flush is too early.

### 34c — conhistory in the gamedir, no stray root file  *(engine, console.c + fs.c)*
`conhistory.txt` was written to the install ROOT (`FS_ROOT`); changed `Con_History_Load`/`Con_History_Save` ([console.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\client\console.c) 553/590) to `FS_GAMEONLY` so it lives in `nettest/`. The 0-byte one that kept reappearing in the root was the home-vs-base **writability probe** ([fs.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\fs.c) ~8383) which opened `conhistory.txt` in append mode (creating it); changed it to probe a throwaway `.fte_writeprobe` and `Sys_remove` it. Root stays clean.

### 34d — ODE plugin fully static (no loose runtime DLLs)  *(plugins/Makefile)*
The install shipped `libwinpthread-1.dll` (+ unused `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, `libstdc++-6.dll`) because `fteplug_ode_x64.dll` linked winpthread dynamically (`-lpthread`). Added `-static` to the ODE link recipe ([plugins/Makefile:265](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\plugins\Makefile)); objdump confirms the rebuilt DLL imports NONE of the three. All three runtime DLLs can be deleted from `C:\FTEQuake`. (Force-relink note: `make -B` rebuilds ODE from a tarball that's gone — instead `touch` a source like `engine/common/com_phys_ode.c` to relink only the DLL.)

**Build/deploy:** engine `m-rel` (client: cl_main.c/client.h/renderer.c/console.c/fs.c) + `sv-rel` (fs.c shared) + the ODE plugin. Deploy `fteqw64.exe`, `fteqwsv64.exe`, `fteplug_ode_x64.dll`. **Adding a field to client_static_t is ABI-safe (appended at the end) since cls is defined in cl_main.c which is recompiled.**

---

## Patch 35 — CoD `checkpvs` NULL-deref crash (CODBSP_ClusterPVS missing the NULL-buffer fallback)  *(APPLIED, cod plugin)*

**Symptom:** calling the `checkpvs(viewpos, ent)` builtin on a **CoD (IBSP) map** can crash (NULL-pointer segfault) when the viewpoint lands in a clusterless leaf — i.e. the eye is in the void / clipped into solid (spectator/noclip, camera pushed into a wall, a brief spawn frame). The other four BSP families the mod loads (Q1, Q2, Q3, HL2/VBSP) never crash here. This is a **latent crash in the existing `cl_bulletholes_pvs_check` feature** (default **on**, client/cl_bulletholes.qc) on CoD maps, independent of any new work.

**Root cause:** `PF_checkpvs` ([engine/common/pr_bgcmd.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\pr_bgcmd.c) ~1406-1427) always passes `pvsbuffer = NULL` to `worldmodel->funcs.ClusterPVS(cluster, NULL, PVM_FAST)`, then dereferences the result in `EdictInFatPVS`. Every BSP format guards the NULL-buffer case with an `if (!buffer) buffer = &staticrow;` fallback so it never returns NULL — **except CoD.** `CODBSP_ClusterPVS` ([plugins/cod/codbsp.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\plugins\cod\codbsp.c) ~233) returned the packed pvs pointer only for a valid cluster; for an out-of-range/`-1` cluster (which `CODBSP_ClusterForPoint` can legitimately return for a void point) the `if (pvsbuffer)` fallback was skipped (buffer is NULL) and it hit `return NULL` (codbsp.c:262). `CODBSP_EdictInFatPVS` then derefs `pvs[l>>3]` (codbsp.c:479) → crash. CoD was the only one of the five missing the guard. The engine's own fail-safe (`!funcs.FatPVS → visible`) doesn't fire because the CoD plugin *does* register PVS funcs.

**Fix:** add the same fallback the other formats already have — a file-static `pvsbuffer_t codpvsrow;` and, at the top of `CODBSP_ClusterPVS`, `if (!pvsbuffer) pvsbuffer = &codpvsrow;`. Now an invalid/`-1` cluster falls through to the existing `if (pvsbuffer)` branch (realloc + zero) and returns a valid all-zero row (= "nothing visible", cull-in-void — same benign behaviour as VBSP/Q2/Q3) instead of NULL. The valid-cluster `PVM_FAST` path (what the renderer's per-frame scene cull uses) is **unchanged** — it still returns the direct pointer, so normal CoD rendering is unaffected. Mirrors [mod_vbsp.c:3039](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\plugins\hl2\mod_vbsp.c) / gl_q2bsp.c exactly.

**Why it was done:** a multi-agent investigation of `checkpvs` cross-format safety (before adding an opt-in PVS-based dropped-weapon cull, `r_physdrops_pvscull`, in the mod's CSQC) verified the fail-safe path of all five formats against source and found CoD to be the sole CRASHES verdict. This one-line guard makes `checkpvs` universally crash-safe, which (a) lets the new QC `r_physdrops_pvscull` run safely on any map, and (b) retroactively de-risks the existing `cl_bulletholes_pvs_check` on CoD maps.

**Build/deploy:** rebuild the cod plugin (`make -C plugins release/fteplug_cod_x64.dll FTE_TARGET=win64 CC=gcc OUT_DIR=release BASE_CFLAGS="…"`); the final `EMBEDMETA` step needs `zip` (absent here) and is non-fatal — the linked DLL before it is complete and the deployed DLL never carried the metazip anyway. Deploy `fteplug_cod_x64.dll`. Plugin compiles clean (pre-existing indentation warnings only) and autoloads without ABI issue. The `checkpvs`-NULL path itself is hard to stage headlessly, so the crash-fix is code-verified (a faithful copy of the VBSP pattern); normal CoD map load/render is unaffected by construction.

## Patch 36 — accurate 1:1 player hit detection on IQM models (engine spine bend + native per-bone hitboxes)  *(APPLIED, engine + QC)*

**Symptom:** player hit detection on the IQM player models was inaccurate and inconsistent between `sv_trust_clienthits` 0 (server-authoritative, lag-comped) and 1 (client-authoritative). The up/down view-pitch **lean** made you miss leaning targets; hitgroups were wrong (a hand raised to head height read as a *headshot*, "both legs read as left leg"); and the two trust modes disagreed. The goal: exact, forgiving, CS-style per-bone hitboxes that match the rendered silhouette **identically on both sides, regardless of trust setting.**

**Root cause (the saga):** the player models are **IQM** (`mod_alias`). (1) The third-person view-pitch lean + strafe twist were applied **only on the client**, as a QC `skel_set_bone` deform on the visual proxy, while the **server collision pose was always upright** — so server traces (and the client's own trace) never matched the leaning render. (2) FTE **cannot trace per-bone hitboxes on IQM at all** — `MOVE_HITMODEL` traces mesh triangles; only Half-Life `.mdl` (`HLMDL_Trace`) had engine hitboxes — so "use only hitboxes" was impossible in QC, and the gamecode fell back to a Z-height guess. Both required **engine** changes.

This is two engine features plus a chain of trust-1 client fixes. All engine edits in [common/com_mesh.c](C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine\common\com_mesh.c) (+ `.h`), tagged `//nettest`.

### Part A — engine-native view-pitch/twist spine bend (so the SERVER pose leans)
- **`Alias_ApplySpineBend()`** (com_mesh.c): a bit-for-bit C port of the client QC `PlayerVis_LoadBoneBasis`/`TwistBone`/`PitchBone` (cl_player.qc). Rotates the named spine bones (`Bip01 Spine/Spine1/Spine2/Spine3/Neck`) in **parent-relative** (`SKEL_RELATIVE`) space — extract `(fwd,right,up)` via the engine bone↔qcvector convention (col0=fwd, col1=**−**right, col2=up; see pr_skelobj.c `bonemat_toqcvectors`), orthonormalize, twist (rot right/up about fwd) then pitch (rot fwd/right about up), same per-bone fractions, write back. Driven by `framestate->g[FS_REG].subblend2frac` (= v_angle_x/90, pitch) and `.subblendfrac` (= leg_twist/90, twist) — values the gamecode **already** set on both sides and that **lag-comp already rewinds** (sv_lagcomp.qc), so no new fields/networking and lag-comp is automatic. Bone indices cached on `galiasinfo_t.spinebend_bone[5]`.
- **`Alias_GetBoneInformation` wrapper** (renames the original to `_Raw`): when `Alias_SpineBendActive()` is true, fetch the blended pose as `SKEL_RELATIVE` into a **private** copy (the raw fast-path can return shared static frame data — must memcpy before mutating), bend it, then convert to the requested type. Covers the render (`Alias_BuildSkeletalMesh`) and `Mod_Trace`. `Mod_GetTag` routes through the bent `SKEL_ABSOLUTE` pose too (it has its own bone walk).
- **Gated `r_skel_spinebend`** (CVARFD, default 1, registered in `Alias_Register`). **CRUCIAL:** `Alias_SpineBendActive` returns false when `framestate->bonestate` is set — i.e. when a **QC skeletal object** drives the entity. So the engine bend applies to the **SERVER** player (its skeleton is cleared each tick) but NOT the **client visual proxy** (which keeps its own QC `skel_build` skeleton + QC spine deform). Applying the engine bend on top of the proxy's QC skeleton double-bent it and visibly **warped the gun attachment** — this split avoids that. Tuning reads the existing `cl_player_spine_pitch_*`/`_twist_*` cvars via cached `Cvar_FindVar`.

### Part B — native per-bone hitbox collision for IQM (mirrors `HLMDL_Trace`)
- **`galiasinfo_t`** gains `int numhitboxes; aliashitbox_t hitbox[MAX_ALIASHITBOXES(32)]` (`{int bone; int hitgroup; vec3 mins,maxs}`) — IQM has no native hitbox chunk.
- **`Mod_AddHitbox(model, bonename, hitgroup, mins, maxs)`**: resolves the bone name against the head `galiasinfo` and stores the box (idempotent on re-precache). Exposed to QC as the **`addmodelhitbox` builtin** (`PF_addmodelhitbox` in pr_skelobj.c — compiled into both progs like `PF_modelframecount`; prototype in pr_common.h; registered in the pr_cmds.c **and** pr_csqc.c builtin tables; name-bound `#0`).
- **`Mod_Trace_Hitbox()`**: a near-verbatim port of `HLMDL_Trace`'s 6-plane slab test, but in **model space** — the ray is already model-local (`start_l/end_l`) and the bones come from `Alias_GetBoneInformation(SKEL_ABSOLUTE)` (with the Part A bend / QC skeleton already applied), so no axis is baked into the bones. On hit it sets `trace->surface_id = box hitgroup` (HL's own convention) and `trace->bone_id = bone+1`. **Must zero `brush_face/bone_id/brush_id/surface_id` at function entry** (HL memsets the whole trace; `Mod_Trace` doesn't) or a MISS leaves stale fields → OOB `norm[]`/`bones[]` + a phantom hitgroup to QC.
- **`Mod_Trace` hook** (right after `trace->fraction = 1`): `if (mod->numhitboxes && framestate && (mod->contents & contentsmask)) return Mod_Trace_Hitbox(...)` — **replaces** the mesh trace for player models ("only hitboxes").
- **QC:** the 20-box `$hbox` table (shared/sh_weapons.qc) is registered per player model at precache via `Hitbox_RegisterModel(precache_model(...))` in `precache_everything` (both progs; no-ops on the sini `.mdl` and unknown bones, `checkbuiltin`-guarded). `W_HitgroupClassify` (sh_weapon_logic.qc) returns `trace_surface_id` directly when `bone_id>0 && surface_id∈1..7`, ahead of the legacy Z-height guess.

### THE trust-1 fix (single argument) + the client-prediction chain
With Parts A+B, **trust-0 worked perfectly** but **trust-1 (client) passed straight through players.** Causes, in order found:
1. **`MAX_BONES` vs `inf->numbones`** — `Mod_Trace_Hitbox`/`Mod_Trace` called `Alias_GetBoneInformation(..., MAX_BONES, ...)`, but a QC skeleton's `bonestate` is only honored when `framestate->bonecount >= numbones`. Player skeletons have ~50 bones; `50 >= 256` is false → **the engine silently discarded the posed skeleton and traced the bind pose** (offset from the render — a ray through the player's origin sailed past their boxes). The render asks for `inf->numbones` (~50 ≥ 50 ✓), which is why the model looked right while the trace missed. **Fix: `MAX_BONES` → `inf->numbones`/`mod->numbones`** in both trace calls (server no-skeleton path is unaffected — `Alias_FindRawSkelData` already clamps).
2. **Client proxy posed at render time but traced at prediction time** — the proxy's engine framestate is only written in predraw (render), which runs *after* the fire trace; with the QC skeleton re-enabled (Part A split) the persistent skeleton supplies a valid posed `bonestate` even a frame stale, so re-enabling it was what fixed the placement.
3. **Hitgroup clobber** — the FX between the trace and the hitclaim (`CSQC_BulletImpactSilent` re-traces for the impact decal) zero `trace_bone_id`/`trace_surface_id`, so `W_HitgroupClassify`/`CSQC_SendHitclaim`/`CSQC_TryPredictDeath`/`cl_debug_impacts` re-derived a Z-height guess (arm-at-head-height → **headshot**). **Fix:** capture the hitgroup at the instant of the hit and thread it through (`optional in_hitgroup` on `CSQC_SendHitclaim` + `CSQC_TryPredictDeath`). This also fixed a **phantom headshot kill** (client predicted a kill on an arm hit; victim alive on the server → "dead body you can re-shoot").
4. **Double damage flinch** — the attacker predicted the flinch AND the server multicast `CSQC_EVENT_PLAYER_FLINCH` re-stamped it ~RTT later, restarting the anim. **Fix:** client dedup latch `vis_flinch_pred_until` (cl_main.qc handler skips the re-stamp during the prediction window; witnesses still see it once).

**Why it was done:** the user wanted "perfect 1:1 hit groups regardless of trust settings… server-side skeleton AND accurate client-authoritative hitgroup, only if the engine supports it." Engine investigation confirmed it was feasible with no blockers. Verified in-game on a listen server: trust-0 and trust-1 both land box-accurate hits with correct hitgroups (arm-at-head-height reads as arm, not headshot) on every IQM player model (arctic/gign/gsg9/sas/guerilla/leet/terror/urban/chickenman/numberK/kilmer — each registers 20/20 boxes); the gun attaches correctly; the flinch fires once. Sini (`.mdl`, Half-Life) uses its own native `HLMDL_Trace` path and is unaffected by this work.

**Build/deploy:** rebuild the engine — `$env:TMP="C:\msys64\home\Lex\tmp"` (writable, **Windows-style** path or MinGW gcc fails "Cannot create temporary file in C:\WINDOWS"); ucrt64 PATH; `make -C C:\msys64\home\Lex\fteqw\engine m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64` → copy `release/fteqw64.exe` → `C:\FTEQuake`. Recompile QC: `fteqcc64_latest.exe sv_progs.src` + `cl_progs.src`. The `addmodelhitbox` registration is verified headlessly via the developer-gated `[hitbox] <model> idx=<n> registered N/20 boxes` print (all IQM players 20/20; sini 0/20 no-op).

**Follow-up polish (QC-only, after the core landed):**
- **Double damage flinch (shooter saw it twice):** the attacker predicts the flinch locally AND the server multicasts `CSQC_EVENT_PLAYER_FLINCH` to everyone. A client-side time-window latch failed at high ping (the window must beat RTT, impossible at `sv_minping 500`). Fixed timing-independently: the server tags the flinch event with the **attacker slot** (`num_for_edict(attacker)`, +1 wire byte, size 4→5) and the attacker's own client **skips** it (they already predicted it). Witnesses still see it once. Mirrors the footstep exclude pattern.
- **Hitgroup lost to FX clobber:** the impact-FX re-trace (`CSQC_BulletImpactSilent`) zeroed `trace_bone_id`/`trace_surface_id` before the hitclaim, so an arm-at-head-height Z-fell-back to HEAD — making the hitclaim mis-classify AND `CSQC_TryPredictDeath` predict a **phantom headshot kill** (victim alive on the server → "dead body you can re-shoot"). Fixed by capturing the hitgroup at the instant of the hit and threading it through (`optional in_hitgroup` on `CSQC_SendHitclaim` + `CSQC_TryPredictDeath`; also fixes the `cl_debug_impacts` label).
- **Debug overlays:** the drawn boxes were Y-mirrored ("backwards feet") because `gettaginfo` returns `v_right = -col1` while the engine trace uses raw `col1` — fixed by negating `v_right` in all three draws (`CSQC_DrawDebugHitboxes`/`CSQC_DrawServerHitboxes`/`CSQC_DrawContinuousHitboxes`). `sv_debug_hitboxes 1` (per-shot) snapshots the lag-comped pose; `2` (continuous, sv_main.qc) streams the live pose and the client extrapolates `frame1time` to animate — both correct once un-mirrored.
- **Wireframe draw — DON'T use `type beam` particles for it.** Briefly switched the per-edge draw from `R_BeginPolygon` to `trailparticles` beams; this looked like the upper-body boxes (head/arms) just stopped drawing. Root cause: FTE `type beam` segments come from a tiny **HARDCODED 2048-slot pool** (`MAX_BEAMSEGS`, `p_script.c:396` / `r_numbeams` `:3494`; `r_part_beams` is on/off only, NOT a size — separate from the 262144 `r_part_maxparticles` pool), and each box edge subdivides into `length/step` segments — so ~8 boxes (the lower body) filled 2048 and every box above the spine **silently dropped** (`free_beams==NULL` → break, `:5818`). It also shares that pool with weapon tracers/gauss/egon. **Reverted to `CSQC_DebugBeam` (immediate-mode `R_BeginPolygon` thin camera-facing quad per edge)** — no cap (32k verts/batch, ~12% at 4 targets), ~0.5ms for ~1000 edges, draws every frame so it tracks precisely. `particles/debug.cfg` deleted. (Investigated with a 4-agent workflow; the `v_right` feet fix + per-hitgroup colours were kept.)

> **BUILD-AND-DEPLOY LESSON:** the dedicated server runs **`fteqwsv64.exe`** (`start_dedicated_server.bat`), which is the **`sv-rel`** target — NOT `fteqw64.exe` (`m-rel`). A server-side engine patch is NOT live until you **rebuild `sv-rel` AND redeploy `fteqwsv64.exe`** (and restart the server). After deploying only `m-rel`, the dedicated server still denied copy-protected `.wad`s — the `set sv_allow_download_anything 1` in ftesrv.cfg was a dead cvar in the stale `sv-rel` binary. Always rebuild **both** `m-rel` and `sv-rel` for server-side patches.

**Why:** the server denied clients downloading files that live inside a **copy-protected** mounted game folder, logging `<player> denied download of maps/de_dust2_css_2026.bsp - it is copyrighted` (also `models/skeleton.mdl`). The `mapfrom css/cs/hl/cod` addon mounts (Patch 8 / Steam dirs) are flagged `SPF_COPYPROTECTED`, and a **loose** file inside such a mount **inherits** that flag (`fs.c` ~3930/4202/4373). `SV_LocateDownload()` (`sv_user.c`) then hard-denies it. This fires **even with the correct installs** — the flag is about *where the file is mounted from*, not whether the player owns it. The loose-file branch (`else if (copyprotected)` → "it is copyrighted") had **no cvar override** (the pak branches at least honour `allow_download_pakmaps`/`allow_download_pakcontents` == 2).

**What it adds:** a server cvar **`sv_allow_download_anything`** (default `0` = byte-for-byte stock). When `1` it does **two** things so a client can pull *everything a mounted-game map needs* in one go: (a) `SV_LocateDownload` ignores `SPF_COPYPROTECTED` on the server's own searchpaths (loose *and* pak), and (b) `SV_AllowDownload` lifts the per-type asset gates (`allow_download_other`/`textures`/`wads`/etc.) so paths like `gfx/env/*` and `materials/skybox/*` aren't blocked. **Still NEVER** hands out **logs** or **configs** (`.cfg` / `config(s)/` — they leak the rcon password). Path/name safety (`..`, absolute, drive) is unchanged.

**The edits** (all tagged `//nettest P37`):
1. `sv_main.c` (~`:100`, after `allow_download_other`) — `cvar_t sv_allow_download_anything = CVARFD(... "0", CVAR_WARNONCHANGE, ...)`.
2. `sv_main.c` (~`:6012`) — `Cvar_Register(&sv_allow_download_anything, cvargroup_serverpermissions);`.
3. `sv_user.c` (~`:3471`) — added to the `extern cvar_t` list inside `SV_LocateDownload`.
4. `sv_user.c` (right after `copyprotected = …`, ~`:3630`) — `if (sv_allow_download_anything.ival) copyprotected = false;`. One line: both `else if (copyprotected)` branches fall through to "allowed" and the package-redirect path also works.
5. `sv_user.c` `SV_AllowDownload` (~`:3354`) — added to its `extern cvar_t` list.
6. `sv_user.c` `SV_AllowDownload` (right after the logs block, ~`:3388`) — `if (sv_allow_download_anything.ival) { if (cfg/config(s)) return false; return true; }`. Placed AFTER the logs check and BEFORE the per-type gates; blocks configs explicitly, allows every other asset. Without this, the skybox (`gfx/env/*`, `materials/skybox/*`) hit `allow_download_other` (default 0) and were denied "due to path/name rules" even with the copyright veto lifted.

**Mod side:** `C:\FTEQuake\nettest\ftesrv.cfg` sets `set sv_allow_download_anything 1` (dedicated server; `set` so it creates regardless of cvar-registration order). A **listen host** doesn't exec ftesrv.cfg — set it in console / autoexec there if needed. Stock engine without this patch: unknown cvar, denial stays.

**Verify:** with the cvar `0` the deny line still prints; with `1` it's gone and the transfer proceeds (maps, wads, skybox faces, misc assets). Server-only change (compiled into both `m-rel` and `sv-rel`).

## Patch 38 — `FS_GAMEDOWNLOADS`: route client downloads into `<gamedir>_downloads/`  *(APPLIED, client/common)*

**Files:** `engine/common/common.h` (1) + `engine/common/fs.c` (3) + `engine/client/cl_parse.c` (1)  ·  search `//nettest P38`

**Why:** the user wants downloaded content to land in a **sibling `nettest_downloads/` folder** instead of mixing into the active gamedir `nettest/`, "to keep the game files pure". The client previously wrote every loose download to `FS_PUBGAMEONLY` (the active gamedir). FTE already segregates *package* downloads (`package/` → `FS_ROOT`'s `downloads/`) and addon-game downloads (`<addongame>_downloads`, Patch 8's `FS_Addon_Mount`); this extends the same idea to the **active gamedir's loose downloads**.

**What it adds:** a new `fs_relative` value **`FS_GAMEDOWNLOADS`** that resolves to `<base-or-home>/<gamedir>_downloads/<file>` (sibling of the gamedir, derived from the `gamedirfile` global). Only the client download path uses it, so configs/screenshots/demos still write to `nettest/`. The folder is mounted as a normal read searchpath so the downloads load.

**The edits** (all tagged `//nettest P38`):
1. `common.h` (~`:690`) — enum member `FS_GAMEDOWNLOADS` after `FS_PUBBASEGAMEONLY` (sorts after `FS_GAME`, so `FS_RELATIVE_ISSPECIAL` stays false).
2. `fs.c` `FS_NativePath` (new `case`, ~`:2943`) — resolve to `<com_gamepath|com_homepath>/<gamedirfile>_downloads/<fname>` (mirrors `FS_GAMEONLY` + `_downloads`; returns false if no gamedir). `FS_SystemPath`/`FS_CreatePath`/`FS_Rename` all route through this.
3. `fs.c` `FS_OpenVFS` (~`:3154`) — add `case FS_GAMEDOWNLOADS:` to the shared `FS_PUBGAMEONLY`/`FS_BASEGAMEONLY`/`FS_PUBBASEGAMEONLY` block (FS_SystemPath + `COM_CreatePath` on write + `VFSOS_Open`). **Required** — that switch's `default:` is `Sys_Error`.
4. `cl_parse.c` `DL_Begun` (~`:2064`) — the final `else` fsroot `FS_PUBGAMEONLY` → `FS_GAMEDOWNLOADS`. `package/`(FS_ROOT) and `skins/`(FS_PUBBASEGAMEONLY) branches unchanged. The temp→final rename (`:2647`) uses the same fsroot both ends → same-dir rename.
5. `fs.c` `FS_ReloadPackFilesFlags` (~`:5503`, just before `FS_AddDownloadManifestPackages`) — mount `<gamedirfile>_downloads` as a searchpath via the **low-level** `FS_GetOldPath`/`VFSOS_OpenPath` + `FS_AddPathHandle` (NOT `FS_AddSingleGameDirectory`/`FS_AddGameDirectory`, which would clobber `gamedirfile`/`pubgamedirfile`/`gameonly_gamedir`). Base follows `com_homepathenabled` to match the write path. Flags **`SPF_ADDON|SPF_ISDIR`** — `SPF_ADDON` appends it at the **tail (lowest priority, BELOW the mod)**, mirroring the `cstrike_downloads` precedent in `FS_Addon_Mount`, so the mod's own files always win and a stale download can never shadow a mod asset; an addon path is also never a write target (so it can't steal config/general writes), and `FS_FileIsAddonOnly` correctly skips auto-exec of any downloaded `config.cfg`/`autoexec.cfg`. **NOT** `SPF_COPYPROTECTED` (our own files, keep them re-servable — the download-out gate keys on `SPF_COPYPROTECTED`, and the package-advertisement filter that *does* skip `SPF_ADDON` is CRC/package-only, irrelevant to loose files) / **NOT** `SPF_TEMPORARY` (would be purged at map change). `VFSOS_OpenPath` tolerates a not-yet-existing dir, so the first download is found without a remount.

**Result:** downloads land in `C:\FTEQuake\nettest_downloads\…`, load via `FS_FLocateFile` like gamedir files at LOW priority (so `nettest\` always wins on a name collision — a stale download can't shadow a mod update), and `nettest\` stays pure. On a stock engine without this patch downloads go to the gamedir as before. Pairs with Patch 37 (server sends, client files them away).

**Verified (headless boot, `-condebug +path`):** `path` lists `$basedir/nettest_downloads` BELOW `$basedir/nettest (e)(w)` and ABOVE the addon games; `nettest_downloads` is read-only (no `(w)`) and not `(c)` copyprotected; the `sv_allow_download_anything` cvar registers (default `0`); no FS/`Sys_Error`. End-to-end download test (real client↔server) is the user's: trigger a download → file appears under `nettest_downloads/` (not `nettest/`), `.tmp` renamed cleanly, `map <name>` renders it; `nettest/` did not gain the file.

## Patch 39 — auto-download a mounted-game map's skybox faces  *(APPLIED, client-only)*

**Files:** `engine/client/cl_parse.c` (1 function)  ·  search `//nettest P39`

**Why:** a client without the mounted game (CS/HL/Source) downloads the map + its wads fine (the wad list is already requested by `CL_CheckHLBspWads`), but the **skybox faces are never requested** — so the sky renders black with `Sky "skybox_<name>" missing texture: materials/skybox/<name>_rt` (the `Con_DPrintf` at `gl_shader.c:733`, the last fallback path the sky loader `Shader_ParseSkySides` tries). Nothing in the engine auto-downloads missing textures (no download calls in `image.c`), and the Q2 path even has a `FIXME: parse entity lump for sky name`. So the skybox needs an explicit download request, like the wads.

**What it adds:** `CL_CheckHLBspWads` (cl_parse.c) now also parses the worldspawn **`skyname`** (or Q1 `sky`) and, for each of the 6 faces, requests the two common conventions — GoldSrc `gfx/env/<name><side>.tga` and Source `materials/skybox/<name><side>.vtf` (sides `rt/bk/lf/ft/up/dn`) — with `DLLF_REQUIRED` so they arrive before the sky shader builds. The server serves whichever exists (it must permit them: the SV_AllowDownload bypass in **Patch 37**); the rest resolve as not-found (no hang — same as a missing wad). They land in `nettest_downloads/` (**Patch 38**) and the sky loader's existing patterns (`gfx/env/%s%s`, `materials/skybox/%s%s` — its own nettest skybox patch) then find them.

**The edit** (tagged `//nettest P39`): one rewrite of `CL_CheckHLBspWads`. **Critical detail:** the original used the *outer* entity-lump cursor `s` as its inner wad-list parser (`s = wads; while((s = COM_ParseToken(s,";")))`) and therefore `return`ed immediately after the `wad` key (the cursor was destroyed). To also reach `skyname` (which may appear before OR after `wad`), the inner loop now uses a **local cursor** `char *p = wads` so the outer `s` survives, the loop runs to `}`, then the skybox requests fire after it. Wad handling (request `textures/<wad>` `DLLF_REQUIRED`) is byte-for-byte unchanged; return value still `false`.

**Scope:** GoldSrc (`BSPVERSIONHL`) maps — the path that has the worldspawn wad+sky. Source/VBSP maps load via the plugin, not `CL_CheckHLBspWads`; if a VBSP map needs the same, mirror this in its loader. Requesting both conventions means ~6 of the 12 requests not-found on any given map (the wrong convention) — cheap and silent. Stock engine: no skybox download (black sky for clients lacking the game).

**Verify:** connect a client lacking the game to a server hosting a GoldSrc map with a skyname → the 6 face files appear under `nettest_downloads/gfx/env/` (or `nettest_downloads/materials/skybox/`) and the sky renders instead of black. Needs Patch 37 active on the server (incl. the `sv-rel` rebuild) so `gfx/env/*` / `materials/skybox/*` aren't denied.

## Patch 40 — in-game console: drop the spurious tab-complete `/` + arrow-navigable completion  *(APPLIED, client-only)*

**Files:** `engine/client/keys.c` (`CompleteCommand` + the K_UPARROW/K_DOWNARROW handlers)  ·  search `//nettest`

**Why:** (a) pressing Tab to complete inserted a leading `/` you didn't type (`r_drawviewmodel` → `/r_drawviewmodel`). Root cause: `CompleteCommand` did `if (cl_chatmode.ival) Key_ConsoleInsert("/")` unconditionally at **two** sites; `cl_chatmode` defaults to 2 so every completion prepended `/`. (b) FTE already renders the match list (highlighted via the global `con_commandmatch`) and **Tab/Shift-Tab cycle it**, but Up/Down only did command history — no Source-style arrow selection of the dropdown.

**What it does:** (a) capture whether the user's line **actually started** with `/`/`\\` (`qboolean had_slash` at the existing slash-skip in `CompleteCommand`) and gate both inserts: `if (cl_chatmode.ival && had_slash)`. Now bare→bare, `/cmd`→keeps the `/`; execution is unchanged (chatmode-2 runs bare recognised commands; the `/` was a redundant disambiguator). (b) at the top of the K_UPARROW/K_DOWNARROW handlers, if a completion is active (`con_commandmatch != 0` **and** `Cmd_Complete(line)->num > 1`), the arrow runs `CompleteCommand(false, ∓1)` (reusing the exact Tab-cycle path) and returns — i.e. **Tab opens the list, Up/Down move the highlight, Enter accepts** (Enter already honours `con_commandmatch`); otherwise it falls through to history as before. No new rendering — the highlighted list + inline greyed preview already exist.

**Scope:** client console only. Stock engine: the `/` reappears and Up/Down are history-only. A full *as-you-type* dropdown (vs Tab-driven) is deferred.

## Patch 41 — dedicated-server terminal: readline-style line editing  *(APPLIED, server-only / `sv-rel`)*

**Files:** `engine/server/sv_sys_win.c` (`Sys_ConsoleInput` + `Sys_Printf`)  ·  search `//nettest`

**Why:** the dedicated server's Windows cmd console (`fteqwsv64.exe`) had no line editing. `Sys_ConsoleInput` was a raw `_kbhit()`/`_getch()` loop handling only Enter/Backspace/Tab/printable; **arrow keys arrive as a `0x00`/`0xE0` prefix + a scan byte, both echoed verbatim → the `àKàHàP` garbage**, plus no history, no cursor movement (append-at-end only), so copy-paste-then-edit corrupted the line.

**What it adds (all in sv_sys_win.c, no threading — keeps the non-blocking `_getch` poll):**
- A **caret** (`coninput_cursor`) + a **command-history ring** (`SVCON_HIST 32`) with two static helpers `SVCon_SetLine` (rub-out + reprint a line) and `SVCon_HistAdd` (push on Enter, skip blanks/dupes).
- **Extended-key dispatch:** on `c==0||c==0xE0`, read the scan byte — **Left/Right** caret move, **Up/Down** history, **Home/End**, **Delete** — and **swallow any other extended key** (this alone kills the garbage echo). Other control chars (`c<32`) are swallowed too.
- **Insert/delete at the caret** (printable + Backspace + Delete) with proper tail-redraw (reprint the tail, trailing space to clear the old glyph, backspace back to the caret). Tab-complete sets caret to end.
- **`Sys_Printf` cursor-awareness:** before its existing erase it advances the terminal caret to end, and after reprinting `]<input>` it backspaces `(len - cursor)` to restore a mid-line caret. (No-op when nothing is being typed, so normal logging is unchanged.)

**Build/deploy:** server file → **rebuild `sv-rel` + redeploy `fteqwsv64.exe`** (and restart the server) — see [[engine-build-and-patches]]; the in-game console (Patch 40) is `m-rel`/`fteqw64.exe`. **Verify (interactive):** in the cmd window, Left/Right move the caret, Up/Down recall history, Home/End/Delete work, arrow keys no longer print `àK…`, and a log line printed mid-edit doesn't corrupt the input line. Stock engine: raw-mode garbage as before.

## Patch 42 — in-game console: cursor/completion fixes + Ctrl+L / Ctrl+W / cvar-default / Ctrl+F search  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

**Files:** `engine/client/keys.c` + `engine/client/console.c` (+ 1 decl in `common/console.h`)  ·  search `//nettest`

Follow-up to Patch 40. Three bug fixes + four niceties, all in the in-game console. Client-only → `m-rel`/`fteqw64.exe`.

**Bug fixes:**
- **Right-arrow inserted spaces** — in the shared text-entry handler `Key_EntryLine`, the K_RIGHTARROW case at end-of-line fell to `else unicode = ' ';` (keys.c:1654) → the space got inserted by the printable-char path. Changed to `else return true;` (Right-at-EOL is a no-op everywhere, standard).
- **Spurious trailing space after a sole-match completion** ("invisible spacer" that blocked Left-arrow re-completion) — removed the `if (c->num == 1) Key_ConsoleInsert(" ");` in `CompleteCommand`.
- **`clear` while scrolled up stayed stuck** — `Con_ClearCon` reset `display`/`current` but not `con->displayscroll`; the stale value failed the auto-scroll-to-bottom gate in `Con_PrintCon` (`displayscroll==0`), so new prints didn't pin to the bottom + the `^^^^` indicator persisted. Added `con->displayscroll = 0;` in `Con_ClearCon` (console.c).

**Niceties (all in `Key_Console`/`Key_EntryLine` unless noted):**
- **Ctrl+L** = clear the console (`Con_ClearCon(con)`).
- **Ctrl+W** = delete the word before the caret (readline-style; reuses the existing Ctrl+←/utf_left word-walk).
- **Cvar value + default on Tab** — `Key_UpdateCompletionDesc` already showed the cvar's current value in the footer; added its `var->defaultstr` so the footer reads `name value (default X)`.
- **Ctrl+F search-in-scrollback** — new `Con_SearchText(con, text, dir)` (console.c, declared in console.h) walks `conline_t` from `con->display` in `dir`, decodes each line via `CON_CHARMASK`, case-insensitive substring match; on a hit it scrolls (`con->display = line`) and selects the span (`selstartline/offset` + `CONF_KEEPSELECTION`) so the existing selection-draw highlights it. `Key_Console` adds a `con_findmode` + `con_findtext[64]`: **Ctrl+F toggles** the `find:` bar (footer) on/off; while open, typing jumps to the newest match, **Enter/F3** = next older, **Shift+Enter** = newer, **Backspace** edits. **Esc closes the find bar** — but Escape is consumed in `Key_Event` (keys.c ~:3090, just before it removes `kdm_console`) *before* the per-console `Key_Console` dispatch, so the find-mode exit had to be hooked THERE, not in `Key_Console` (an in-`Key_Console` Esc handler is dead for Escape). Ctrl+F-toggle gives a second guaranteed exit.

**Follow-ups (same patch, later):**
- **Plain Home/End scroll the console** — were Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End only (input-cursor home/end fell through to `Key_EntryLine`). Dropped the `&& ctrl` on the two handlers in `Key_Console` (keys.c ~:2096) so plain **Home → top** (`con->display = con->oldest`), **End → bottom** (`= con->current`); they now always `return true` (consume the key before the input-cursor handler runs). Word-jump (Ctrl+←/→) still reaches the input line.
- **Scrollbar on the right of the floating console** (`console.c` `Con_DrawConsole` `CONF_ISWINDOW` path): narrowed the content (scissor + `Con_DrawOneConsole` width `wnd_w-16` → `wnd_w-24`) to free an 8px strip on the right, and draw a track + thumb there (`R2D_FillBlock`/`SRGBA`). The thumb height = `visible/total` lines, position from counting `oldest→display`. **No new mouse code** — that strip is already the existing `CB_SCROLL` drag region (keys.c ~:1998), so dragging it scrolls and the thumb tracks `con->display`. (Window console only; the non-window drop-down is unchanged.)
  - **CRASH FIX (boot SIGSEGV):** the thumb-height math first used `Font_CharHeight()` — which returns the **global `curfont->charheight`** (gl_font.c:2880), and `curfont` is **NULL** at this point in `Con_DrawConsole` (it's only bound later, inside `Con_DrawOneConsole` via `Font_BeginString`). With `con_window 1` the console window draws on the first frame → NULL deref → `0xC0000005` on launch. Fixed by using the **explicit-font** `Font_CharVHeight(font_console)` (takes the font as an arg, no `curfont`). LESSON: in any draw code OUTSIDE a `Font_BeginString`/`Font_EndString` pair, never call the argless `Font_CharHeight()`/`Font_CharWidth()` — use the `Font_Char*Height(struct font_s*)` variants. (Also: a `+quit` headless smoke-test renders no frame, so it misses console-draw crashes — verify with a few seconds of real rendering.)
  - **FOLLOW-UP FIXES (after first use):** (1) the window content + my scrollbar draw *outside* the `if (Key_Dest_Has(kdm_cwindows))` focused-block (closes at console.c ~:3296), so a **closed** console kept drawing the scrollbar + the `^^^^` backscroll indicator (faded). Fixed: in the `else` (unfocused) branch, snap `w->display = w->current` + `displayscroll = 0` (kills the `^^^^` AND scrolls back to the bottom so it reopens at the live end — the user's "scroll back down on close" ask), and gate the scrollbar draw on `Key_Dest_Has(kdm_cwindows)` so it only shows when focused. (2) The bar reused the existing `CB_SCROLL` drag, which is a *relative content-grab* (drag down = pull content down = scroll UP) — wrong for a scrollbar. Added **`CB_SCROLLBAR`** (console.h enum): the window-scrollbar strip now sets `CB_SCROLLBAR` on mouse-down (keys.c hit-test) and `Key_GetConsoleSelectionBox` handles it as an **absolute** map — mouse-Y in the track → `con->display` position (top=oldest, bottom=newest), so dragging DOWN scrolls DOWN and the thumb follows the cursor. Release is the catch-all `CB_NONE` (keys.c ~:1288), no special handling.

**Build/deploy:** client-only → `make m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64` → `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify (interactive):** Right at EOL inserts nothing; complete a unique command → no trailing space + Left re-triggers completion; scroll up + `clear` + type → view snaps to bottom, no `^^^^`; Ctrl+L clears; Ctrl+W deletes a word; Tab a cvar → footer shows value + default; Ctrl+F + term → jumps to/highlights matches, Enter/Shift+Enter walk them, Esc closes; **Home/End jump to top/bottom**; a **scrollbar** shows on the right of the `con_window` console + drags. Stock engine: none of these.

## Patch 43 — IQM frame-blend bone renormalize (player-model "warp" fix)  *(APPLIED, client+server / `m-rel` + `sv-rel`)*

**File:** `engine/common/com_mesh.c` (`Alias_BlendBoneData` + new `Alias_RenormalizeBoneMatrix` + cvar `r_skel_blendnormalize`)  ·  search `//nettest warp fix`

**Why:** IQM player/bot models warped intermittently — torsos/arms (and the attached gun) scaled up massively for a frame. A QC detector (`PlayerVis_CheckWarp`) showed `Bip01 Head` and the root `Bip01` reporting an **inf** absolute bone scale on every player, plus the gun's clavicle/flash/Line02 bones at 15–26× during firing. Root cause: `Alias_BlendBoneData` blends animation frames with a **linear weighted sum of 3×4 matrices** (`pose = Σ frac·matrix`). A linear blend of rotation matrices is no longer orthonormal — the basis shrinks/skews — and on a **SKEL_RELATIVE** skeleton that per-bone scale **compounds geometrically down the parent chain** (root → pelvis → spine → neck → head), overflowing the deepest bones to a giant/`inf` absolute scale. The same upper-body scale fed the QC weapon-mirror (`gettaginfo` → `skel_set_bone_world`) and bent the gun. Render, `gettaginfo`, and `skel_get_boneabs` all use the same chain-walk, so the warp is real, not a measurement artifact.

**Fix:** after each **blended** bone (the single-frame `frac==1` path is an exact `memcpy`, untouched), Gram-Schmidt the 3×3 column basis back to a clean rotation — normalize col0, orthogonalize col1, `col2 = col0×col1` with the **original handedness preserved** (so it never mirrors), translation column untouched. Gated to `skeltype == SKEL_RELATIVE` (where compounding happens) and the new cvar **`r_skel_blendnormalize`** (default 1; set 0 only for models that bake intentional non-unit bone scale). This removes the compounding at its source for ALL models, so the QC per-bone orthonormalize (`PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeSkeleton`, ~0.2s/frame) can drop back to the cheap 5-spine-bone version.

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` is common → **rebuild BOTH** `make m-rel` (`fteqw64.exe`, render) **and** `make sv-rel` (`fteqwsv64.exe`, server hit-detection pose) — see [[engine-build-and-patches]]. **Verify:** spawn a bot match, hold any weapon (incl. HDAK), watch + switch weapons → no torso/arm/gun warps; with `cl_skel_warp_log 1` the `[skelwarp] BODY … Head … inf` spam is gone. Toggle `r_skel_blendnormalize 0` → the warp returns (confirms the lever). Stock engine: warps as before.

**Follow-up (same patch):** the first cut only renormalized the RENDER blend (`Alias_BlendBoneData`), but `skel_build` (the CSQC builtin that populates the player proxy's QC skeleton — what's actually rendered + read by `gettaginfo`/`skel_get_*`/the weapon mirror) fills its bonematrix via a **separate** blend path (`Mod_GetBoneRelations`, `pr_skelobj.c`), so the warp persisted. Fixed by exporting `Alias_RenormalizeBoneMatrix` (un-static) and renormalizing every (re)built bone at the end of `PF_skel_build` (same `r_skel_blendnormalize` + `SKEL_RELATIVE` gate). `pr_skelobj.c` is client-side → the `skel_build` half is `m-rel` only, but `com_mesh.c` (the export) is shared → rebuild **both**. With this, the QC-side `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeSkeleton` (~0.2 s/frame) can drop back to the cheap 5-spine-bone cleanup.

## Patch 44 — `gl_line_width`: CSQC debug wireframe lines respect glLineWidth (scoped to debug lines)  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

**Files:** `engine/client/renderer.c` (cvar def + register) · `engine/gl/gl_backend.c` (`BE_SubmitMeshChain` injection + `GLBE_Init` range query) · `engine/gl/gl_alias.c` (`R_DB_Poly` un-static)  ·  search `//nettest:` near each.

**Why:** the mod's CSQC debug overlays (nav graph, hitboxes, impacts, physprops, skeleton, …) now draw as true `GL_LINES` (cheap 1px wireframe via the `CSQC_DebugLine` → `R_BeginPolygon` 2-vertex path; engine sets `BEF_LINES` when `nv==2`, `pr_csqc.c:1635`). The user wanted those lines **thicker without reverting to camera-facing quads**. But `BE_SubmitMeshChain` (the GL_LINES draw, gl_backend.c:3139) **never called `qglLineWidth`**, so true lines were pinned at 1px. The QC-side `cl_debug_wire_thickness` only achieves thickness by switching to quads (2 tris + per-edge orientation math).

**What it adds:** a `gl_line_width` cvar (default 1) applied at the single GL_LINES injection point. **Scoped to debug lines only:** 2D `drawline` (the crosshair accents, `R2D_Line` → `BE_DrawMesh_Single` → `GLBE_DrawMesh_List`) and particle line-trails share the `BEF_LINES` path but draw through `shaderstate.dummybatch`, whereas the CSQC scene polys (the debug overlays) are the only batches whose `buildmeshes == R_DB_Poly` (set in `BE_GenPolyBatches`, gl_alias.c:2885). So the injection is gated on `shaderstate.curbatch->buildmeshes == R_DB_Poly` — debug wireframe thickens, crosshair + tracers stay 1px. `R_DB_Poly` was made non-static so gl_backend.c can name it.

**Driver caveat (handled):** `glLineWidth > 1` is clamped to the driver's `GL_ALIASED_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE`; **core** GL profiles cap it at 1. This build defaults to a **compatibility** profile (`vid_gl_context_forwardcompatible 0`), so wide lines work here. `GLBE_Init` now queries the range once into `gl_maxlinewidth` (clamps the cvar) and, if the driver max ≤ 1, prints a one-time note to use `cl_debug_wire_thickness` (quads) instead. `r_showtris`/outlines are unaffected — they use `glPolygonMode(GL_LINE)` on triangle batches, not the `BEF_LINES` batchtype.

**No QC change.** `gl_line_width N` (with `cl_debug_wire_thickness` at its default 1, so QC still emits lines) gives cheap thick lines. The two knobs stay complementary: `gl_line_width` = thick **lines** (cheap, driver-dependent); `cl_debug_wire_thickness` = thick **quads** (works on any driver, costs more — and since quads aren't `BEF_LINES`, `gl_line_width` is ignored when it's >1, so no double-apply).

**Build/deploy:** renderer/GL-backend only → **`make m-rel`** (`fteqw64.exe`); the dedicated server has no GL backend, so **no `sv-rel`**. Deployed to `C:\FTEQuake\fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** `developer 1` → console shows `GL_ALIASED_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE: [1, N]`; `sv_debug_nav 1` + bots, `gl_line_width 1/4/8` → nav/hitbox/impact lines thicken (up to the driver cap) while the crosshair accents + tracers stay thin. Stock engine: lines stuck at 1px.

## Patch 45 — `gl_2dline_width`: thick 2D `drawline` strokes (hit-marker reticle) without the offset-stack hack  *(APPLIED, client + QC / `m-rel`)*

**Files:** `engine/client/renderer.c` (cvar) · `engine/gl/gl_backend.c` (`BE_SubmitMeshChain` else-branch) · QC `client/cl_hud.qc` (`HUD_DrawHitmarker`).  Sibling to Patch 44.

**Why:** the hit-marker (the diagonal-X reticle, `HUD_DrawHitmarker`) faked line thickness by drawing each of its strokes `HITMARKER_WIDTH` times at ±0.5px offsets ("Draw multiple offset lines to simulate thickness") — which read on screen as **several faint reticles layered on top of each other**. Now that the engine can apply `glLineWidth` to lines (Patch 44), the hit-marker can draw single clean strokes at a real width. The 2D `drawline` builtin (`PF_CL_drawline`, pr_menu.c:1063) even has a `width` arg, but it's **commented out** (`//float width = …`) — the engine has always ignored it.

**What it adds:** a `gl_2dline_width` cvar (default 2, matching the old `HITMARKER_WIDTH`) applied at the **same** GL_LINES injection point as Patch 44, but on the **2D path**: 2D `drawline` (`R2D_Line` → `GLBE_DrawMesh_List`) draws through `shaderstate.dummybatch`, so the branch is `else if (shaderstate.curbatch == &shaderstate.dummybatch) lw = bound(1, gl_2dline_width.value, gl_maxlinewidth)`. Fully separate from `gl_line_width` (which is gated on `buildmeshes == R_DB_Poly`, the 3D debug scene polys) — so debug-wireframe width and reticle width are independent. Everything else that hits the GL_LINES path (particle trails, etc.) falls through to `lw = 1`.

**QC:** `HUD_DrawHitmarker` drops the `for (i<HITMARKER_WIDTH)` offset loop and draws **4 single diagonal strokes** (one per corner of the X); thickness now comes from `gl_2dline_width`. `HITMARKER_WIDTH` const removed (unused). The main crosshair (`HUD_DrawCrosshair`) is unaffected — it's `drawfill` rectangles sized by `cl_crosshairthickness`, never `drawline`.

**Scope note:** `gl_2dline_width` controls ALL 2D `drawline` strokes; in this mod the hit-marker is the only `drawline` user (the crosshair is drawfill), so it's effectively the reticle width. Driver-clamped like `gl_line_width` (compat profile here → works; core caps at 1).

**Build/deploy:** `m-rel` (`fteqw64.exe`) + QC (`fteqcc64.exe progs.src`). No `sv-rel`. **Verify:** land a hit → the X reticle is a clean single-width X (not layered duplicates); `gl_2dline_width 1/4/8` changes its thickness; `gl_line_width` (debug) does NOT affect it and vice-versa.

## Patch 46 — renormalize `skel_set_bone_world` writes (the CSQC half of the Patch 43 warp fix; kills the QC per-bone scrubs)  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

**File:** `engine/client/pr_skelobj.c` `PF_skel_set_bone_world` (~line 2461)  ·  search `//nettest warp fix (Patch 46)`.

**Why:** Patch 43 renormalized the bones `skel_build` fills, but **`skel_set_bone_world`** — the other QC path that writes a bone — does `Matrix3x4_Multiply(childworld, parentinv, bone)` and stores the result **verbatim, no renorm**. A non-unit `childworld` (gettaginfo chain-walks the deformed spine and compounds residual IQM frame-blend scale) or non-unit `parentinv` lands on the bone and, on a relative skeleton, compounds down the chain + feeds the gun mirror's R-Hand source (flash/gunmesh/Line02 balloon at render). The CSQC player code worked around this with two QC scrubs every frame per player: a **5-spine-bone** `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeBone` pass after the spine deform, and a **whole-gun-skeleton** `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeSkeleton` after the weapon-mirror loop. A profile showed those at ~0.105s (gun) + part of 0.088s (post-deform) — the largest remaining QC cost after the blood-drop + body-orthonormalize wins.

**Fix:** one line at the tail of `PF_skel_set_bone_world` — `if (skelobj->type == SKEL_RELATIVE && r_skel_blendnormalize.ival) Alias_RenormalizeBoneMatrix(bone);` — the exact mirror of Patch 43's `skel_build` renorm (same exported `Alias_RenormalizeBoneMatrix` from `com_mesh.c`, same `r_skel_blendnormalize`/`SKEL_RELATIVE` gate). Every `skel_set_bone_world` write now arrives unit, so `PlayerVis_YawBone`/`PitchBoneWorld` (the spine deform) and the gun-mirror loop produce clean bones with no QC follow-up. The render renorm cost moves from QC (skel_get/skel_set builtins + per-element NaN validation) into a cheap inline Gram-Schmidt in C — net cheaper, and the QC scrubs are deleted.

**Paired QC change** (`client/cl_player.qc`): removed the post-deform 5-bone `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeBone` scrub and the gun `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeSkeleton` scrub (both now redundant). `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeSkeleton` is now unused (harmless); the pre-deform 7-bone scrub stays (covered by Patch 43, cheap belt-and-suspenders on the deform's inputs). `r_skel_blendnormalize` is now the single master switch for the whole warp-fix system — at 0, with the QC scrubs gone, warps return (its documented "models that bake non-unit bone scale" escape hatch).

**Build/deploy:** `pr_skelobj.c` is client-side (the server uses the Patch 36 engine spine path, not `skel_set_bone_world`) → **`m-rel`** (`fteqw64.exe`) + QC. No `sv-rel`. **Verify:** bot match, hold/switch weapons incl. HDAK, `cl_skel_warp_log 1` for a round → no torso/arm/gun warps, no `[skelwarp]` spam; toggle `r_skel_blendnormalize 0` → warps return (confirms the engine renorm is now the only thing holding them off). Re-profile: the gun `OrthonormalizeSkeleton` (0.105s) and the post-deform `OrthonormalizeBone` are gone.

## Patch 47 — `sys_framepacing` enhancements: present-cadence telemetry + non-GL fallback + ARB_sync fence  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

Three refinements to the existing `sys_framepacing` system (the custom high-precision FPS-limiter / present-pacer; the core already mirrors SpecialK's timer+spin hybrid, `1.125×`/`2.875×` thresholds). Files: `client/sys_win.c`, `gl/gl_screen.c`, `gl/gl_vidcommon.c`, `gl/glquake.h`  ·  search `nettest`/`RecordPresent`/`FenceSync`.

**1. Present-cadence telemetry** (`sys_win.c` + `gl_screen.c`). The stats only measured *wait* error (requested vs actual sleep); added a parallel ring (`g_present_ring`) sampling the actual **present-to-present interval** via `Sys_FramePace_RecordPresent()` (called from `gl_screen.c` right after `VID_SwapBuffers`, every mode). `sys_framepacing_stats` now prints a "Present cadence" block: avg interval/fps, min/max, jitter (stddev), spread. This is the real VRR-smoothness metric — lets you SEE mode 4's flat cadence vs mode 2's render-variance jitter even when wait-accuracy looks identical.

**2. Mode-4 non-GL fallback** (`sys_win.c`). Mode 4 (present-pacing) only has a hook in `gl_screen.c`, so on D3D11/Vulkan it silently did nothing. Now `Sys_FramePacePresentActive()` returns true only when `qrenderer == QR_OPENGL`, and `Sys_FramePacingAnchor()` returns true for mode 3 **or** mode 4 off-GL — so mode 4 cleanly degrades to the mode-3 frame-START grid anchor on non-GL renderers instead of being a no-op. Help text + stats text updated to say so.

**3. ARB_sync fence instead of glFinish in mode 4** (`gl_screen.c` + `gl_vidcommon.c` + `glquake.h`). The mode-4 GPU drain was a full `qglFinish()`; now it prefers a per-frame `GL_ARB_sync` fence (`qglFenceSync` → `qglClientWaitSync(GL_SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT, ≤100ms)` → `qglDeleteSync`) — surgical "this frame done" with less collateral stall, marginally tighter hold. Added the three entry points to the GL loader (`getglext`, NULL-safe) + a `GLsync` typedef/enums to `glquake.h`; **falls back to `qglFinish()` if the context lacks ARB_sync** (pre-GL-3.2), so it's risk-free. (Honest: smallest practical gain of the three; the fallback makes it safe.)

**Build/deploy:** client/renderer only → **`make m-rel`** (`fteqw64.exe`); editing `glquake.h` triggers a broad GL recompile (expected). No `sv-rel`. **Verify:** `sys_framepacing 2` → `sys_framepacing_stats` (note present-cadence jitter); `sys_framepacing 4` → jitter drops sharply (flat cadence) while wait-error stays tight; visibly smoother on a VRR/G-Sync display at ~1 frame more latency. Mode 4 on a D3D11 build now behaves as the mode-3 anchor (not a no-op).

**Follow-up:** added a **"mode-4 GPU drain"** line to `sys_framepacing_stats` — reports `ARB_sync fence` vs `glFinish (ARB_sync absent)` vs the off-GL fallback, so you can confirm the fence (item 3) is actually live. Implemented via a `GLQUAKE`-guarded `GLVID_FramePaceDrainPath()` accessor (`gl_vidcommon.c`, returns `qglFenceSync?1:2`) called from the stats command — mirrors the `D3D11QUAKE`/`D3D11_GetFrameLatencyWaitHandle` extern pattern. **VALIDATED in fullscreen** (360Hz, `cl_maxfps 300`, vsync 0): mode 4 present-cadence stddev **67µs vs mode 2's 865µs (~13× flatter)**, avg locked 300fps. Mode 4 is **fullscreen-only** — windowed/DWM owns the present + G-Sync won't engage, so it reads worse there; see [[sys-framepacing-mode4-fullscreen]].

## Patch 48 — `skel_build` blend: two latent bugs = the REAL player-model "warp" root cause  *(APPLIED, client+server / `m-rel` + `sv-rel`)*

This is the actual root cause of the player/bot model warp that Patches 43 + 46 (basis renormalize) and a large QC `PlayerVis_GuardSkeletonTranslations` bind-snap workaround were *compensating the symptom of*. Patches 43/46 renormalize the **basis** (the linear blend de-orthonormalizes the 3×3) — real and still correct — but the visible warp was a **pure translation** corruption (limbs rendered several times their length, or flung across the map, with no thickness change), which renorm never touches (it preserves the translation column). Two distinct bugs in `skel_build`'s blend path produced it; both reproduce **headless** during a bot firefight (the transition frames), so they were pinned by instrumenting `Alias_BlendBoneData` directly. Files: `engine/common/com_mesh.c`, `engine/client/pr_skelobj.c`  ·  search `//nettest fix`.

**Bug A — cross-group pose read (the "across the map" garbage flings, bones to ~1e12 u).** `engine/common/com_mesh.c` `Alias_BlendBoneData` (~line 1263/1268). `Alias_FindRawSkelData` fills a **separate** `lerps[]` slot per bone-group (`lerps++` per group; with a basebone torso/leg split the torso group is `lerps[1]`). The blend loop iterates groups via `lerp`, and correctly uses `lerp->frac`/`lerp->skeltype`/`lerp->pose[0]` (in the `memcpy` fast-path) — **but the blend path read `lerps->pose[b]` (always group 0)** instead of `lerp->pose[b]`. For group 1, when its `lerpcount` exceeds group 0's, `lerps[0].pose[b]` dereferences an **uninitialised pose pointer** → garbage keyframe data → whole-limb translation blowup on a transition frame. **Fix:** `lerps->pose` → `lerp->pose` (both reads). Consistent with the `memcpy` fast-path right above it; for `numgroups==1` it's a no-op, so zero risk for non-split models.

**Bug B — uninitialised framestate → phantom frame-blend influences (the uniform ~7–18× "stretched limbs").** `engine/client/pr_skelobj.c` `PF_skel_build` (~line 1993, before `Get_FrameState`). The `framestate_t fstate;` is an **uninitialised stack local**, and `cs_getframestate` only fills frame-blend slots **[0] and [1]** (the 4-slot `FRAME_BLENDS>=4` path is `#if 0`'d out and never zeroes [2]/[3]). So slots [2]/[3] keep **stack garbage** — `Alias_BuildSkelLerps` then blends in two *phantom* poses (the correct ~11.4 u bind pose) with **garbage weights** (captured live: `f[2]=2.354`, `f[3]=14.219`; Σ≈17.6 → 11.4 u × 17.6 ≈ 200 u). Renorm fixes the basis but leaves the scaled translation → the limbs render stretched with a clean basis. **Fix:** one line — `memset(&fstate, 0, sizeof(fstate));` before `Get_FrameState`. Slots [2]/[3] are now zero-weight → dropped → only the real [0]/[1] influences blend.

**Paired QC change** (`client/cl_player.qc`, `shared/sh_cvar_table.qc`): with the engine producing correct skeletons, the entire QC warp-workaround stack is **deleted** — `PlayerVis_GuardSkeletonTranslations` + the per-model bind-translation cache (`PlayerVis_BindSlot`/`g_bind_*`), `PlayerVis_CheckWarp` + the BODY/GUN warp-catch resets, the dead `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeSkeleton`, and the `cl_skel_warp_log` cvar. The spine-deform + its 7-bone `PlayerVis_OrthonormalizeBone` pass stay (those are for the aim/strafe lean, not the warp).

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` + `pr_skelobj.c` are shared (the server also `skel_build`s for hitbox/lagcomp skeletons) → rebuild **both** `m-rel` (`fteqw64.exe`) + `sv-rel` (`fteqwsv64.exe`) + QC. **Verify:** packed bot match + firefights, hold/switch weapons incl. HDAK → no stretched/flung limbs. Headless repro for regression: `+set sv_bot_minplayers 10 +map fy_iceworld` with the (former) `cl_skel_warp_log 1` detector showed `[skelfix]` firing every firefight frame before; **0 across 3×35 s boots** after. (Note: Patches 43/46 + `r_skel_blendnormalize` stay — they fix the orthogonal **basis** de-orthonormalization; Patch 48 fixes the **translation** corruption.)

## Patch 49 — GoldSrc `.mdl` masked-texture (foliage) alpha inversion: `HLSHADER_MASKED` missing `#MASKLT=1`  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

GoldSrc v10 `.mdl` props/models with **masked** (alpha-tested) textures — e.g. foliage leaves — rendered with **inverted alpha**: the transparent chroma zone filled **opaque black** and the opaque leaf shape was **discarded/missing** (the same model is correct in HLAM). File: `engine/gl/model_hl.h` (one line).

**Root cause.** The HL masked shader `HLSHADER_MASKED` (model_hl.h:42-50) requests the GLSL permutation `program defaultskin#MASK=0.5` — it defines `MASK` but **not `MASKLT`**. In `engine/shaders/glsl/defaultskin.glsl` (~412-419) the masked branch is:
```
#elif defined(MASK)
  #if defined(MASKLT)
     if (col.a < MASK) discard;   // keep opaque leaf  ← correct
  #else
     if (col.a >= MASK) discard;  // discards leaf, keeps the transparent (palette idx 255 = RGB 0 = black) texels  ← the bug
  #endif
```
With no `MASKLT` it takes the `#else` branch and discards the opaque leaf while keeping the transparent index-255 texels (which are black) → exactly the symptom. The masked **palette** build in `gl_hlmdl.c` (~582-607: index 255 → alpha 0, all others → alpha 255) is **correct**; only the shader's discard direction was wrong. The pass's `alphaFunc GE128` (which maps to `#MASK=0.5#MASKLT=1`) was overridden by the explicit MASKLT-less program permutation.

**Fix.** model_hl.h:44 — `program defaultskin#MASK=0.5#MASKLT=1` (was `#MASK=0.5`). Forces the `if (col.a < MASK) discard` branch → keeps the leaf, drops the transparent zone. `alphaFunc GE128` kept (now consistent). The redundant masked-flag test at gl_hlmdl.c:425 (`(flags & MASKED) || (flags & (MASKED|ALPHASOLID))` ≡ `(flags & (MASKED|ALPHASOLID))`) is harmless and left as-is.

**Build/deploy:** GL-side header (only `gl_hlmdl.c` includes it) → rebuild `m-rel` (`fteqw64.exe`) only; render-only, no `sv-rel`/QC. **Verify:** a GoldSrc foliage prop renders leaf opaque + surround transparent, matching HLAM (no black fill, no missing leaf); chrome / fullbright / plain HL models unchanged (the edit only flips the masked shader's alpha-test direction).

## Patch 50 — Scaled tri-mesh prop collision: apply entity `.scale` to the per-triangle model trace  *(APPLIED, shared server+CSQC / `m-rel`)*

A model entity's `.scale` was applied by the RENDERER but never by COLLISION — a scaled `prop_static`/`prop_detail` IQM prop rendered 2× but you collided with the un-scaled mesh. File: `engine/server/world.c` (`World_ClipMoveToEntity`, the model-trace branch ~line 1166).

**Cause.** The model trace (`World_TransformedTrace` → `funcs.NativeTrace`, world.c:895) transforms the ray by entity origin + angles but never by `ent->xv->scale` (the `framestate_t` has no scale field). The OBB box path is fine once QC scales the bbox (it reads only `mins`/`maxs`), but the per-triangle `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` narrowphase traces the raw mesh vertices.

**Fix.** In `World_ClipMoveToEntity`'s model-trace branch, when `solid == SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` and `ent->xv->scale` is a positive non-1: uniform scale commutes with the origin-translate + angle-rotate, so pre-scale the ray + moving box **about `eorg` by 1/scale** before `World_TransformedTrace`, then un-scale `trace.endpos` back by `scale`. `trace.fraction` + the plane normal are scale-invariant under uniform scale → no fix-up. Gated on `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` so SOLID_BSP/brush traces are untouched; no `World_TransformedTrace` signature change. `world.c` is shared, so this also applies to the **CSQC predicted pmove** — so a scaled prop with the QC "Predicted collision" flag mispredicts nothing.

**Paired QC** (mod, no engine dependency — `server/sv_props.qc`): scales the broadphase/PVS bbox `setsize(self, mins*scale, maxs*scale)` (also the full BOX-path fix), and adds the opt-in **Predicted-collision** CSQC mirror (`predprop_Send` / `CSQC_PredProp_Update`, `CSQC_ENT_PRED_PROP = 20`) so a handful of hero props feel client-predicted-solid (PVS-gated; never dense clutter — that's the Patch 25 flood).

**Build/deploy:** `world.c` (shared into `m-rel`) → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** a `prop_static` `.iqm` at `scale 2` collides at the 2× shape (walk into the scaled mesh, not the small one); non-scaled props + SOLID_BSP/brush traces unchanged.

## Patch 51 — IQM degenerate bounds → tiny collision bbox: union vertex extents always  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

A static IQM `prop_static`/`prop_detail` with `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` collided as a DOT — the player walked through the full-size mesh — because the model's collision BBOX was tiny. File: `engine/common/com_mesh.c` (`Mod_ParseIQMMeshModel`, ~line 9473).

**Cause.** FTE derives an IQM's `mod->mins/maxs` from the file's per-frame **bounds chunk** (com_mesh.c:9289), and only falls back to vertex-derived bounds when the chunk is ABSENT (`if (!h->ofs_bounds || !h->num_frames)`). Some exporters write a **degenerate/zero bounds chunk** for static models, so `mod->mins/maxs` stayed tiny → the mod's `Props_SetupModel` substituted the ±16 fallback cube → the trimesh **broadphase** (`World_ClipToLinks`, world.c:1881 — AABB-reject by the entity `absmin/absmax`) rejected the per-triangle narrowphase across the whole van. The mesh rendered full-size but collided as a ±16 dot. (Render is fine because rendering uses the mesh, not the bbox.)

**Fix.** Make the vertex-bounds union **unconditional** (drop the `if (!h->ofs_bounds…)` gate): always `AddPointToBounds(opos[i], …)` over the base verts. This corrects a bad/empty static-model chunk by folding in the real mesh extent, while preserving animated models' larger per-frame chunk bounds (union keeps the max — a good chunk already encloses the bind pose, so well-formed models are unchanged). The IQM now gets a mesh-covering bbox → broadphase admits the whole prop → trimesh collides everywhere (server, and the flag-8 CSQC mirror which sends the now-correct bbox).

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` (shared into `m-rel`) → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** a `.iqm` van prop → walk into it, you collide with the mesh shape (no walk-through); `sv_debug_physprops 1` no longer prints "degenerate bbox" for it. Non-IQM (.mdl) loaders + good-bounds IQMs unchanged.

## Patch 52 — SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH hybrid: mesh for point/line, oriented box for the swept player  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

After Patch 51 a SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH IQM prop stopped **bullets** at the mesh but the **player still walked through**. File: `engine/server/world.c` `World_ClipMoveToEntity`.

**Cause.** `Mod_Trace_Trisoup` (the trimesh narrowphase, `com_mesh.c`) tests only a single impact point against the triangle's face + 3 edge planes — no swept enter/leave interval, no box bevel planes. A **ray/bullet** (`mins==maxs`) crosses the face plane at one point inside the triangle and hits; a **swept BOX** (player) slips past the per-edge tests → no hit. And per **Patch 3**, even a corrected mesh-vs-box "wedges/stutters on triangle seams" — which is why the filing cabinet uses SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX (`World_OBBTrace`), the smooth swept-box solid. Player movement + bullets share one trace path, so the only difference is box-vs-ray.

**Fix (hybrid, route by the moving extents).** (1) In the `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` branch, if the trace is a swept box (`maxs[i] > mins[i]` on any axis) set `model = NULL` so it falls to the oriented-box path; else (point/line bullet) fetch the model for the per-triangle mesh trace (Patch 50 scale still applies, since point traces keep `model`). (2) Widen the OBB dispatch from `solid == SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX` to `(SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX || SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH)` (both `&& !model && angles`) so a swept-box trimesh with angles → `World_OBBTrace`; at angles 0 the existing box-hull path is already the axis-aligned == oriented bbox. Result: **bullets → exact mesh; player → smooth oriented box** (scale via the QC-scaled bbox; correct extent via Patch 51). No seam stutter, reliable stop.

**Build/deploy:** `world.c` (shared into `m-rel`) → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** walk into a `.iqm` van (rotated + axis-aligned) → the player STOPS smoothly; bullets still hit the exact mesh; flag-8 props are client-predicted (no rubber-band). SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX (cabinet) + BSP/brush + bullet-vs-mesh unchanged.

## Patch 53 — rotated SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH: add it to the broadphase rotation-AABB expansion  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

After Patch 52, a ROTATED trimesh prop only collided with the player inside its UN-rotated AABB — a long van turned 90° lost most of its length (player walked through the part of the rotated box sticking out past the axis-aligned bbox). File: `engine/server/world.c` `World_LinkEdict` (~line 556).

**Cause.** `World_LinkEdict` enlarges an entity's broadphase `absmin/absmax` to enclose its rotated bbox **only** for `SOLID_BSP || SOLID_BSPTRIGGER || SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX` (the OBB-patch list). `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` was absent — fine before, because its trace went straight to the per-triangle mesh, but Patch 52 now routes its swept-box (player) path through `World_OBBTrace`, whose oriented narrowphase only runs if the area-grid broadphase first admits the entity. Without the expansion, the tilted OBB corners get culled before the trace.

**Fix.** Add `|| solid == SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` to the expansion condition. The existing q2 method (`absmin/absmax = origin ± max-half-extent`) then encloses the rotated box for cardinal rotations and most others (same approximation the box/BSP already use). Result: a rotated trimesh prop collides with the player over its full rotated footprint.

**Build/deploy:** `world.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** place a long `.iqm` prop rotated 90° → the player collides along its full (rotated) length, not just the un-rotated AABB. Non-rotated props + the other solids unchanged.

## Patch 54 — Mod_Trace_Trisoup: proper swept-BOX clipping (per-triangle player collision)  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

The user wants the player to collide with the model's actual mesh, not the Patch-52 oriented box. `Mod_Trace_Trisoup` (`common/com_mesh.c`) only tested the **single face-plane crossing point** + per-edge expansion — fine for a **ray** (bullet, `mins==maxs`) but a **swept box** straddling small triangles slips through (no enter/leave interval, no bevel/corner planes).

**Fix.** Branch on `isbox = (mins != maxs)`. **Rays keep the existing proven path** (zero bullet-behaviour risk). A **swept box** clips against each triangle treated as a Minkowski "brush": front + back face (gives the flat triangle box-thickness), the 3 edge side planes, and the 6 axial bevels of the triangle's AABB — each pushed out by the box (`PlaneNearest`), then an **enter/leave-fraction loop** exactly like `CM_ClipBoxToBrush` (`gl_q2bsp.c`). The contact backs off `DIST_EPSILON`; a box that *starts* embedded is **skipped** (not flagged startsolid) so resting/sliding doesn't false-solid and teleport the player. Per-triangle is intrinsically a little bumpy on curved/seamed surfaces (the convex-hull mode, Patch 55, is the smooth alternative).

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** with `sv_prop_collision 1`, walk into an `.iqm` prop → the player stops at the mesh; bullets unchanged.

## Patch 55 — convex-hull (26-DOP) prop collision + `sv_prop_collision` mode switch  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

A smooth, mesh-shaped alternative to per-triangle, and one cvar to A/B all three shapes on the same prop. FTE had **no** convex-hull collision for models (ODE `dConvex` is commented out).

**Build (`common/com_mesh.c`).** At IQM load, beside the Patch 51 bounds union, project the base verts onto the 13 directions of a 26-DOP (`kdop13[]`, a shared `extern const` table — 3 axes + 4 cube corners + 6 edge midpoints, integer/non-unit) and store the per-direction max/min support in new `model_t` fields `kdop[26]` + `haskdop` (`gl/gl_model.h`).

**Trace (`server/world.c` `World_HullTrace`).** The smooth analogue of `World_OBBTrace`: each DOP plane (model space) is rotated into world by the entity angles, scaled by `ent.scale`, shifted by the origin, pushed out by the box (nearest corner), then an enter/leave-fraction loop finds first contact. Convex → no per-triangle seam stutter. The hit normal comes out already in world space (no back-rotation).

**Dispatch (`server/world.c` `World_ClipMoveToEntity`).** Engine cvar **`sv_prop_collision`** (cached via `Cvar_Get`, `CVAR_SERVERINFO`; default **1**) routes a `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` **swept box**: `0`=`World_OBBTrace`, `1`=per-triangle mesh (Patch 54), `2`=`World_HullTrace` (when `haskdop==13`). Replaces Patch 52's unconditional OBB. **Point/line (bullet) traces always use the exact per-triangle mesh** in every mode. No QC/FGD/model changes; the flag-8 predicted mirror inherits the mode (same shared `world.c`). Rotated props are covered by Patch 53 (same solid type).

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` + `world.c` + `gl_model.h` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** walk the same `.iqm` van and toggle `sv_prop_collision 1`/`2`/`0`; bullets still hit the exact mesh in all three; test rotated + scaled props.

## Patch 56 — TRUE convex hull (QuickHull) replaces the 26-DOP; default `sv_prop_collision 2`  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

The 26-DOP (Patch 55) was loose, and the per-triangle default (`sv_prop_collision 1`) both **leaked** (the Patch-54 swept box skips contacts that start inside a triangle slab → player penetrates the near surface) and **lagged** (linear scan of all 6069 van triangles × 30-40 traces/frame × `PM_NudgePosition`'s ~27-33 retries while embedded; skeletal IQMs get no `BIH_BuildAlias`). Root-caused after parsing van_1.iqm: 4839 verts / 6069 tris, extent **131×250×122**, no bounds chunk — so the bbox is full-size (NOT the ±16 fallback); "AABB too small" was a red herring.

**Fix — build a real convex hull and trace against it.** FTE had no hull builder.
- `gl/gl_model.h`: `int haskdop; float kdop[26];` → `int numhullplanes; vec4_t *hullplanes;` (model-space outward unit normal .xyz + dist .w).
- `common/com_mesh.c`: new `Mod_BuildHullPlanes` — an **incremental QuickHull** (validated initial tetra → furthest-point/horizon expansion in double precision → merge near-coplanar faces at ~2°, dist kept conservative-outward → cap 128). Bails to 0 on any degeneracy/overflow. Helpers `Mod_KDOPHullPlanes` (26-DOP) and `Mod_AABBHullPlanes` (6-plane) are the ordered fallbacks, so every static model gets a valid convex hull. Built at IQM load (replaces the k-DOP block). All scratch on `BZ_Malloc`; final planes `ZG_Malloc(&mod->memgroup,…)` (auto-freed). ~30-70 planes for a van.
- `server/world.c` `World_HullTrace`: loop over `model->numhullplanes`/`hullplanes[]` instead of the fixed 26 `kdop13±` dirs (enter/leave-fraction math unchanged; scale `dw = pl[3]*scale + dot(eorg,nw)`). Gate `cm==2 && numhullplanes>=4`. **Default `sv_prop_collision` "1" → "2"** (convex hull).

Result: convex + watertight → **no leak** (player stops at the van silhouette, no nudge thrashing) and **O(numhullplanes)** → **no lag**; scale-aware; bullets/point traces still use the exact per-triangle mesh in every mode. Mode 1 (per-triangle) stays as an opt-in "exact concave" (slow/leaky); mode 0 = box.

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` + `world.c` + `gl_model.h` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** default (`sv_prop_collision 2`) — walk the van: stop smoothly at its convex silhouette, no walk-through, no lag; scale it → collides at visual size; shoot it → bullets hit the exact mesh.

**Addendum — `r_showhull` collision viz.** The QuickHull also bakes its surface triangles into the model (`gl_model.h` `int numhulltris; vec3_t *hulltris;`; filled in `Mod_BuildHullPlanes`). New cheat cvar `r_showhull` (`client/renderer.c`, registered next to `r_showbboxes`): `CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls()` (`client/cl_ents.c`, modelled on `CLQ1_AddVisibleBBoxes`, called right after it) iterates the `r_showhull&3` world (1=ssqc, 2=csqc), and for each `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` edict fetches its model via `w->Get_CModel`, transforms each hull-tri vert by the **same** angle/scale/origin transform `World_HullTrace` uses, and draws the edges with `CLQ1_DrawLine` (green). So the lines land exactly on what the player collides with. `r_showhull 1` on a listen server shows the prop hulls.

## Patch 57 — client-prediction parity + hull cap + epsilon back-off (the prop-collision endgame)  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

After Patch 56 the user still saw cars they could walk into / glitch through, bouncy+sticky barrels, FPS dips, and the van's `r_showhull` showed nothing. Three confirmed root causes (cars are in `fy_killzone.bsp` at scale 0.5 / 1):

1. **Client prediction never matched the server.** Player collision against props runs through the pmove (`common/pmovetst.c` `PM_TransformedHullCheck`), which **always called `model->funcs.NativeTrace` (per-triangle mesh), unscaled, ignoring `sv_prop_collision`** — while the server hull path is scaled. So the client predicted the unscaled per-triangle mesh and the server used the scaled hull → glitch-through / "disagreement", FPS dip (client linear-scans 6069 tris + `PM_NudgePosition` retries), and the collision-smaller-than-the-model feel on the scaled car.
   **Fix:** added **`PM_HullTrace`** (a near-verbatim port of `World_HullTrace`) and a dispatch at the top of `PM_TransformedHullCheck`: if `model->numhullplanes>=4` AND swept box AND `sv_prop_collision==2` (read via cached `Cvar_Get` — the SERVERINFO cvar is synced, so client==server), trace the convex hull instead of the mesh. Threaded a `float scale` through `PM_TransformedHullCheck` (def + fwd-decl + 6 call sites) sourced from a new `physent_t.scale` field (`common/pmove.h`), filled in `CL_SetSolidEntities` (`client/cl_ents.c`) as `state->scale/16.0` (same 4.4 decode as the renderer). Now the client predicts the **same scaled hull** the server uses.
2. **No epsilon back-off in `World_HullTrace`** (and the new `PM_HullTrace`) → the player rested exactly on the plane and re-collided each frame → bouncy+sticky. **Fix:** subtract `0.03125` (DIST_EPSILON) from `enterfrac` before computing endpos, identical on both sides (matches `Mod_Trace_Trisoup`).
3. **QuickHull cap=128 too low** → the van (curved shell, thousands of hull faces) bailed to the k-DOP (no `numhulltris` → no viz). **Fix (`common/com_mesh.c`):** raise the cap to **256**, and when over cap, **merge the new face into the most-parallel existing plane** (keep the looser `.w`, conservative-outward) instead of bailing → the van gets a real convex hull + `r_showhull` viz.

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` + `world.c` + `pmove.h` + `cl_ents.c` + `pmovetst.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** `r_showhull 1` now shows the van's green hull; walk a **scale-0.5 flag-8 car** → stop at the rendered surface, no walk-in/glitch/rubber-band/FPS-dip, smooth slide. NOTE: props need **PROP_PREDICTED (flag 8)** for client-predicted collision; without it they're server-authoritative only (rubber-band) — mass-mirroring is the d1_canals OOM, so it stays opt-in.

## Patch 58 — THE prop-collision root cause: QW `setmodel` never set the entity bbox  *(APPLIED — QC fix + `com_mesh.c`)*

All the Patch 49-57 narrowphase work was gated behind a tiny broadphase box. ROOT CAUSE (finally): the mod is **QuakeWorld progs**, and `PF_setmodel` ([server/pr_cmds.c:3125](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/server/pr_cmds.c#L3125)) transfers the model bbox to the entity **only if** `progstype != PROG_QW || sv_gameplayfix_setmodelsize_qw` — both false by default. So `setmodel(prop, van)` left `self.mins/maxs` at ZERO, the QC's degenerate-bbox guard (`sv_props.qc`) fired, and the prop got the **±16 fallback cube**. That tiny box gated the area-grid broadphase, so the player walked into the model everywhere except near the cube — in every collision mode. The model's real bounds (131×250×122, computed correctly by Patch 51) were never copied to the entity.

**Fix (QC, `server/sv_props.qc` `Props_SetupModel`):** `cvar_set("sv_gameplayfix_setmodelsize_qw","1")` + `cvar_set("sv_gameplayfix_setmodelrealbox","1")` **before** `setmodel`, so QW `setmodel` copies the TRUE model bounds → the degenerate guard no longer fires → `setsize(mins*scale, maxs*scale)` yields the correct, scale-correct van-size bbox → broadphase admits the whole van → the Patch 52-57 hull/prediction/epsilon work finally takes effect. (The mod `setsize`s its own entities, so the global is safe.)

**Engine (`common/com_mesh.c`):** the van's QuickHull (`Mod_BuildHullPlanes`) was blank in `r_showhull` because it overflowed `maxfaces` during construction (dead faces never compacted) and bailed to the k-DOP. Added **dead-face compaction** at the top of each point-insertion when `nfaces > ¾·maxfaces` → big hulls (the car shell) complete → real hull + viz. Plus a developer readout (`Con_DPrintf`) of each IQM's collision `mins/maxs` + `numhullplanes`/`numhulltris`, and `sv_debug_physprops` dprints of the prop's model+collision bbox, so the numbers are visible instead of inferred.

**Build/deploy:** recompile `sv_progs.src` (`qwprogs.dat`) + rebuild `fteqw64.exe`; **reload the map** so props re-spawn. **Verify:** `r_showbboxes 1` → the van box is full van size (not ±16); `r_showhull 1` → van hull shows; player stops at the van in all modes; `sv_debug_physprops 1` (or engine `developer 1`) prints bounds ≈131×250×122 and `hullplanes` > 26.

## Patch 59 — rotated-prop broadphase (exact rotated AABB) + van hull-build robustness  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`)*

Two follow-ups once collision worked:
1. **Rotated van fall-through.** `World_LinkEdict`'s rotation expansion ([world.c:556](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/server/world.c#L556)) used the q2 "max half-extent cube" — which UNDER-covers a long box turned ~22-45° (its corners poke past the cube), so the player fell through the rotated van's ends. (The `#else` branch there was a buggy exact attempt — only rotated 2 of the 8 corners.) **Fix:** replaced it with the **EXACT rotated AABB** — for each world axis, the min/max of `corner·axis` over the box, picking `mins`/`maxs` per the rotated-axis sign, with `AngleVectors`+`VectorNegate(axis[1])` to match `World_OBBTrace`/`World_HullTrace` exactly. Tight (no over-expansion) and covers any angle; strictly better than q2 so rotating BSP brushes are unaffected (still enclosed).
2. **Van QuickHull still bailed** (`r_showhull` blank → k-DOP fallback). Hardened `Mod_BuildHullPlanes` (`common/com_mesh.c`): `maxfaces` 8·num+64 → **16·num+256**, compact dead faces at **½** maxfaces (was ¾), and a developer `Con_DPrintf` at the cleanup bail (`verts/nfaces/nout`) so a remaining failure is visible (nout==0 = face/horizon overflow before the merge; 1-3 = merge too few). A 4839-vert car shell now completes → real tight hull + `r_showhull` viz.

**Build/deploy:** `world.c` + `com_mesh.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** rotate a van 45° → broadphase wraps it, no corner fall-through; `r_showhull 1` shows the van hull; `developer 1` load line reads `hullplanes` > 26 and `hulltris` > 0 (real QuickHull, not k-DOP).

## Patch 60 — hull for HIGH-vert models (decimate) + GoldSrc `.mdl` bounds + `r_showhull` for box props  *(APPLIED, shared / `gl_hlmdl.c` / `m-rel`)*

Three follow-ups after Patch 59. The 4839-vert van STILL bailed (the hardening helped low/mid models but not a 4839-vert curved car shell — the incremental hull's horizon cost still overran), and GoldSrc `.mdl` props had wrong-size collision.

1. **High-vert QuickHull bail → input decimation.** `Mod_BuildHullPlanes` ([com_mesh.c](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/common/com_mesh.c)) builds for low-vert IQM (89–192 verts) but the van (4839) / pine (4495) overflow the horizon-edge guard. **Fix:** before the tetra, if `num > 600`, decimate to ≤512 verts = the 26 `kdop13` EXTREME verts (argmax/argmin per dir — guaranteed on the hull) + a strided subset; build on the decimated set; then **push every final plane out** so `dist = max over ALL original verts of dot(n, vert)` → conservative-outward (encloses every vert, never clips IN). No-op for un-decimated models. `hulltris` come from the decimated hull (viz a hair inside the pushed-out collision — fine). The bail `Con_DPrintf` now shows `verts=decimated/orig`.
2. **Fallback viz.** New `Mod_StoreBoxHullTris` stores a 12-tri bbox as `mod->hulltris` from `Mod_AABBHullPlanes` and `Mod_KDOPHullPlanes`, so a prop that still bails shows its bounding box in `r_showhull` (the `Con_DPrintf` says which fallback). No-op if a real hull stored surface tris.
3. **GoldSrc `.mdl` bounds.** `Mod_LoadHLModel` ([gl/gl_hlmdl.c](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/gl/gl_hlmdl.c)) never set `mod->mins/maxs` (→ 0 → the QC `Props_SetupModel` ±16 fallback → wrong collision). **Fix:** right after the bone pointers (server-inclusive, before the `#ifndef SERVERONLY` block), build a LOCAL bind-pose matrix set from the bones and union the bind-pose model-space verts into `mod->mins/maxs` (the `.mdl` analogue of IQM Patch 51); fall back to the header bbox (`unknown3[1/2]` ideal / `[3/4]` clip) if there are no verts. GoldSrc `.mdl` has no swept NativeTrace → stays `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX`, but now a correct-size oriented box. `Con_DPrintf` "HLMDL collision …".
4. **`r_showhull` box props + diagnostic.** `CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls` ([client/cl_ents.c](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/client/cl_ents.c)) now also accepts `SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX`: a prop with hull tris draws the green hull; one without (a `.mdl`/cabinet box) draws its **oriented bbox** (yellow, 12 edges, `e->v->mins/maxs` rotated by angles, world-scale so sc=1). A one-shot `Con_Printf` on (re)enable lists each visible prop's `solid`/`hullplanes`/`hulltris` so a "blank" prop reports why.

**Build/deploy:** `com_mesh.c` + `gl_hlmdl.c` + `cl_ents.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`. **Verify:** `r_showhull 1` → van + pine show a real green hull (`developer 1`+`reload` → `hullplanes` > 26); `.mdl` props show a yellow oriented box, and `.mdl` collision is the correct model-size box (not ±16; `sv_debug_physprops` shows real bounds). Toggling `r_showhull` prints the per-prop hull-state summary.

## Patch 61 — concave prop collision via convex DECOMPOSITION (`sv_prop_collision 3`, per-submesh N hulls)  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`+`sv-rel`)*

The single convex hull (mode 2) fills in concavities (can't enter a van interior / fit between parts). Added **convex decomposition**: a prop is represented by a SET of convex pieces whose union approximates a CONCAVE shape; the swept box traces all pieces and stops at the nearest entered one (passing freely through concave gaps). Decomposition method = **per-submesh** (one hull per IQM mesh) — cheap, reuses the existing builder; captures concavity BETWEEN parts (single-mesh props fall back to the single hull). Geometric ACD (concavity WITHIN one mesh) is a future Tier-2 on the same infra.

1. **Data ([gl/gl_model.h]):** new `convhull_t {numplanes; *planes; numtris; *tris}` + `int numhulls; convhull_t *hulls` on `model_t` (alongside the single-hull fields, kept for mode 2).
2. **Build ([common/com_mesh.c]):** refactored `Mod_BuildHullPlanes`/`Mod_KDOP`/`Mod_AABBHullPlanes`/`Mod_StoreBoxHullTris` to fill a `convhull_t` (pure, no `mod->*` writes); new `Mod_BuildConvHull` wraps the QuickHull→k-DOP→AABB chain. The IQM loader builds the single all-verts hull (mode 2) AND, if `2 ≤ num_meshes ≤ 32`, one hull per IQM mesh (`mesh[m].first_vertex`/`num_vertexes`) into `mod->hulls[]` (mode 3). Both client+server build it (shared loader) → prediction parity.
3. **Server trace ([server/world.c]):** factored the per-plane clip into `World_HullClipOne`; `World_HullTrace(…, usedecomp, …)` loops the piece(s) and UNIONS — nearest entry fraction wins, `startsolid` if inside ANY piece, one 0.03125 back-off after. Dispatch: `sv_prop_collision 3` → `usedecomp = numhulls>0` (else single hull).
4. **Client prediction ([common/pmovetst.c]):** `PM_HullClipOne` + `PM_HullTrace(…, usedecomp, …)` MIRROR the server bit-for-bit; `PM_TransformedHullCheck` gate handles mode 3.
5. **Viz ([client/cl_ents.c]):** under mode 3, `CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls` draws each piece in a cycling color (so the breakup is visible); the diag line adds `hulls=`.

**Build/deploy:** `gl_model.h`+`com_mesh.c`+`world.c`+`pmovetst.c`+`cl_ents.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe` **and** `fteqwsv64.exe`. **Verify:** `sv_prop_collision 3` + `r_showhull 1` on the van → 3 colored pieces (body + 2 wheels); the player fits between parts where mode 2 blocked; no rubber-band on a flag-8 predicted prop (client matches server). Single-mesh props (stone) stay one hull under mode 3 (expected). Modes 0/1/2 unchanged.

## Patch 62 — load an IMAGE (PNG/TGA/JPG…) as a 1-frame billboard sprite  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

`precache_model`/`setmodel` of an image path (`"sprites/light7.png"`) failed: `Mod_LoadModelWorker` ([gl/gl_model.c]) matched no loader (the PNG magic hits nothing in `modelloaders[]`) → warned `Unrecognised model format PNG` + `mod_dummy`/`MLS_FAILED`, so the mod's `env_sprite` (SOLID_NOT, MOVETYPE_NONE; `scale`/`framerate`/`rendermode` keys) had no model. `.spr`/`.sp2` carry their own dims; a bare image has none, so the loader reads them from the file and synthesizes a sprite — mirroring the external-image path of `Mod_LoadSprite2Model` (.sp2).

1. **New helper `Mod_LoadImageSprite` ([gl/gl_model.c], `#ifndef SERVERONLY`, just before `Mod_LoadModelWorker`):** `ReadRawImageFile(buf,…,&w,&h,…,/*force_rgba8*/true,name)` ([client/image.c:7687]) decodes the in-hand buffer SYNCHRONOUSLY for w/h (pixels freed — only dims wanted). Builds a 1-frame `msprite_t` (`ZG_Malloc`): `type=SPR_VP_PARALLEL`, `numframes=1`, `maxwidth/height=w/h`, bbox `±w/2 (x,y), ±h/2 (z)` (same convention as `Mod_LoadSpriteModel`). One `SPR_SINGLE` `mspriteframe_t`, origin-centered bounds `up=h/2 down=-h/2 left=-w/2 right=w/2` → renders the same world size as an equal-pixel `.spr`; `env_sprite scale` tunes it identically. `frame->image = Image_GetTexture(mod->name, NULL, IF_NOMIPMAP|IF_NOGAMMA|IF_CLAMP|IF_PREMULTIPLYALPHA, …)` (async, like `.sp2`). Sets `mod->type=mod_sprite` → the main-thread `Mod_ModelLoaded`→`Mod_LoadSpriteShaders` builds the frame shader.
3. **Smooth alpha blend ([gl/gl_model.c] `Mod_LoadSpriteFrameShader`):** the default sprite shader keys off `gl_blendsprites` and its 0 branch is `alphafunc ge128` (alpha-TEST/mask) → a soft glow PNG rendered as a hard circle. So when `spr->name` has an image extension, force a new **`SPRITE_SHADER_BLEND`** template (`program defaultsprite` + `blendfunc GL_ONE GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA` premultiplied + `rgbgen/alphagen vertex`) instead of `SPRITE_SHADER_UNLIT` — independent of `gl_blendsprites`, so `.spr`/`.sp2` are unchanged. Paired with `IF_PREMULTIPLYALPHA` above for clean edges. `qrenderer==QR_NONE` → valid `mod_dummy` (precache still succeeds).
2. **Dispatch branch ([gl/gl_model.c], `Mod_LoadModelWorker` inner `else`, `#ifndef SERVERONLY`):** before the `Unrecognised model format` warning, gate by image EXTENSION (`.png/.tga/.jpg/.jpeg/.pcx/.bmp` via `COM_GetFileExtension`+`Q_strcasecmp`) → call `Mod_LoadImageSprite`; success falls through to the existing `MLS_LOADED` path; else the original warning (unchanged). Extension gate is unambiguous — texture PNGs go through `Image_GetTexture`, never `Mod_LoadModel`.

**Dedicated:** `image.o` (`ReadRawImageFile`) is in the client object list only, and `Mod_LoadSpriteModel` is already a dummy stub in `fteqwsv` → the whole patch is `#ifndef SERVERONLY`. A dedicated image precache → `mod_dummy` (the index still networks; the connecting client loads the real sprite). **Mod side:** none — `env_sprite` already `precache_model`s the path. Unpatched engine: image precache warns + `mod_dummy` (invisible, no crash).

**Build/deploy:** `gl/gl_model.c` only → rebuild `fteqw64.exe` (`m-rel`); `sv` target compiles unchanged. **Verify:** an `env_sprite` with `model "sprites/light7.png"` renders as a glow (no `Unrecognised model format`); `scale`/`framerate`/rendermode behave; a non-square PNG (128×64) is aspect-correct and a 64×64 PNG matches a 64×64 `.spr` for size. **Cost:** one extra `ReadRawImageFile` decode per distinct image-sprite precache (cached after), only to read w/h; nil at render time (standard sprite path).

## Patch 63 — prop-hull slide-catching fix: normal-distance back-off + bevel planes  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`+`sv-rel`)*

The player caught/stalled sliding tangentially along a prop hull (`sv_prop_collision 2`/`3`). Two causes, both confirmed against the BSP brush path (which slides smoothly):

1. **Fraction-space back-off.** The hull trace did `enterfrac -= 0.03125` — a back-off of a fixed FRACTION of the move, so a tangential slide kept ~zero normal clearance and re-caught. **Fix:** `World_HullClipOne` ([server/world.c](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/server/world.c)) now also returns `nearfrac = (d1 - DIST_EPSILON)/(d1 - d2)` for the entering plane (the NORMAL-direction back-off, exactly like `CM_ClipBoxToBrush`); `World_HullTrace` unions on the raw `enterfrac` (nearest piece) but moves the player to `nearfrac` (`trace->fraction`), keeping `enterfrac` as `truefraction`. The `-= 0.03125` is gone. Mirrored bit-for-bit in `PM_HullClipOne`/`PM_HullTrace` ([common/pmovetst.c](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/common/pmovetst.c)) for prediction lockstep.

2. **No bevel planes.** A faceted hull with only face planes snags a swept box at convex EDGES (the face-plane box-expansion bulges there). BSP brushes/Q3 facets add axial+edge bevels ([gl_q2bsp.c:820-913](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/common/gl_q2bsp.c#L820)). **Fix:** new `Mod_AddHullBevels` ([common/com_mesh.c](C:/msys64/home/Lex/fteqw/engine/common/com_mesh.c)), called at the end of `Mod_BuildConvHull`, derives the hull's unique verts+edges from `out->tris` and appends up to 6 axial bevels (the model-space AABB planes) + per-edge slanted bevels (candidate = edge × axis), keeping a candidate only if ALL hull verts are behind it (conservative — encloses the model, never clips in). Bevels are plain extra `out->planes` entries → the trace/prediction handle them unchanged; applies to mode 2 and every mode-3 piece. (Bevels carry no viz tris, so `r_showhull` is visually unchanged; the collision is just smoother.)

**Build/deploy:** `world.c`+`pmovetst.c`+`com_mesh.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe` **and** `fteqwsv64.exe`. **Verify:** slide along the van hull in `sv_prop_collision 2` then `3` — smooth, no catch/stall on edges or piece seams; no rubber-band on a flag-8 predicted prop; `developer 1`+`reload` shows a higher `hullplanes=` (faces + bevels). **Cost:** ~2× planes per hull → ~2× the (already-cheap) per-piece trace; bevel build is one-time at load.

## Patch 64 — prop collision pitch matches the rendered mesh (r_meshpitch)  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`+`sv-rel`)*

A prop placed on its SIDE (pitched ~90°) collided FLIPPED vs the visible model. The renderer builds an alias/IQM model's basis with `AngleVectorsMesh` (`mathlib.c:388` — `pitch *= r_meshpitch.value`, `roll *= r_meshroll.value`) for ALL `mod_alias` models, but the hull/OBB/broadphase collision used RAW angles. At `r_meshpitch -1` (the user's setting; default -1 legacy / 1 modern) the render negates the model pitch while collision didn't → mismatch when pitched (coincides at `r_meshpitch 1`). The per-triangle/bullet path (`World_TransformedTrace`) already applied `r_meshpitch` and was correct — the reference.

**Fix:** swap raw `AngleVectors` → `AngleVectorsMesh` (the existing helper; `r_meshpitch`-accessible on the dedicated server) at the alias collision sites, keeping the `VectorNegate(axis[1])`. Bit-identical at `r_meshpitch 1`, so only the legacy `-1` case changes.
- `server/world.c`: **S1** `World_OBBTrace` (~976, SOLID_PHYSICS_BOX — its old "raw is intentional" comment was a mis-diagnosis: it consumes axis world→local exactly like the confirmed-correct bullet path `Mod_Trace`, so it needs the same meshpitch basis); **S2** `World_HullTrace` (~1126, mode 2/3); **S3** broadphase rotated-AABB in `World_LinkEdict` (~575) gated by solid type — `PHYSICS_BOX`/`PHYSICS_TRIMESH` → `AngleVectorsMesh`, `BSP`/`BSPTRIGGER` → raw (else a pitched van falls through after area-grid culling).
- `common/pmovetst.c` (prediction lockstep): **C1** `PM_HullTrace` (~304); **C2** `PM_TransformedHullCheck` per-triangle branch (~400) now gates `model->type==mod_alias` → `AngleVectorsMesh` else raw, mirroring the server — this also **closes a pre-existing mode-1 (`sv_prop_collision 1`) client/server desync** (server applied meshpitch, client didn't).
- **Viz:** `CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls` (client/cl_ents.c) also switched raw→`AngleVectorsMesh` so `r_showhull` lines land on the collision surface for pitched props (else the debug tool used to verify this patch would itself be wrong at `-1`).
- Unchanged (correctly): `World_TransformedTrace` (already meshpitch); `World_ContentsForPoint` + `PM_TransformedModelPointContents` (brush-only point-contents, stay raw); brush `SOLID_BSP` props (render uses raw).

**LOCKSTEP NOTE (important):** collision now depends on `r_meshpitch` (and `r_meshroll`), so for **client-predicted** props the client and server MUST agree on `r_meshpitch`. In practice they do — it's a content constant (callback-forced to ±1, documented "do not change from its default", set per-content by `QUAKEOVERRIDES`), and a listen server shares one cvar. `r_meshroll` is `1` everywhere (roll never desyncs); only `r_meshpitch`'s `-1` legacy default matters. The earlier "bit-identical at `r_meshpitch 1`" claim is true ONLY at `1`; the live `-1` case changes (the fix) and requires the two sides to match. *Optional hardening (not done): mark `r_meshpitch` `CVAR_SERVERINFO` (like `sv_prop_collision`) so the server dictates it — deferred as an invasive change to a core render cvar with menu/disconnected-state implications; unnecessary while the value is content-constant.*

**Build/deploy:** `world.c`+`pmovetst.c` → rebuild `fteqw64.exe`+`fteqwsv64.exe`; `cl_ents.c` (viz) → `fteqw64.exe` only. **Verify** at BOTH `r_meshpitch -1` and `1` (must coincide with the render in both): pitched van (modes 2/3) + cabinet (OBB) collide on the visible surface; `r_showhull` lines sit on it; bullets unchanged; flag-8 predicted prop no rubber-band; `sv_prop_collision 1` on a pitched van (C2) no desync; rotated BSP prop unchanged; at `r_meshpitch 1` bit-identical to pre-patch.

## Patch 65 (Phase A) — Tier-2 geometric ACD (concavity WITHIN a mesh) + per-piece AABB cull  *(APPLIED, shared / `m-rel`+`sv-rel`)*

`sv_prop_collision 3` decomposed per SUBMESH (Patch 61) — concavity between parts, but a single concave mesh (hollow pipe, one-piece arch) still filled solid. Phase A adds a **runtime geometric ACD** + a **per-piece AABB cull**, opt-in via a new load-time cvar; the N-hull trace/union/viz are unchanged.

- **Cvar `sv_prop_decomp`** (CVAR_SERVERINFO, read at model LOAD, default `0`): `0` per-submesh (current), `1` geometric ACD, `2` offline `.acd` sidecar→falls to `1` for now (Phase B). `sv_prop_decomp_concavity` (default `0.06`, clamped 0.01–0.5) = concavity threshold as a fraction of the model extent. Reload to apply.
- **ACD** ([common/com_mesh.c] `Mod_ACDRecurse`): per submesh, recurse over a triangle-index subset — build its convex hull; concavity = `max over verts of (min over hull planes of (plane.w − dot(plane.xyz, v)))` (the deepest mesh vert below the hull; 0 convex, ≈bore radius for a pipe). If `< threshold` / `depth≥8` / `tris≤8` / `count≥64` → emit the hull; else split by a plane through the deepest vert (normal = the bridge face it sits under), partition tris by **centroid side**, recurse. **Empty-child → emit** (termination guard). DETERMINISTIC (no rng, strict tie-breaks, same compiled path) → client/server byte-identical. Bounded: ≤`ACD_PIECECAP 64` useful pieces, array `128`, ≤`4·cap` builds. Each piece's hull is conservative-outward (encloses its tris' verts) so the union never clips in.
- **Per-piece AABB cull** ([gl/gl_model.h] `convhull_t` gains `mins,maxs`, set in `Mod_BuildConvHull`; [server/world.c] `World_HullTrace` + [common/pmovetst.c] `PM_HullTrace`): project the swept player box into the prop LOCAL frame ONCE (`model_pt = axis·(world−origin)`, box-expanded by `fabs(axis)·phalf`), then skip any piece whose `scale·[mins,maxs]` the local swept box can't reach — before the 50–200-plane clip. Only skips clean-misses → result-neutral (can't desync); makes the higher ACD piece count cheap (player overlaps ~1–4 pieces of N). Identical server/client.

**Adversarial review (11 agents):** 5 confirmed. **Fixed:** coverage HOLE — gated ACD to `num_meshes ≤ 32` so the shared piece counter (≤64 cap + ~8 unwind + ≤32 roots ≤ 104 < `ACD_ARRAY` 128) can never reach the hard backstop that drops tris (>32-submesh props fall to per-submesh / single hull). **Documented (deferred):** (a) collision now depends on `sv_prop_decomp`/`sv_prop_decomp_concavity` (CVAR_SERVERINFO, read at load) → client+server must resolve the same value for PREDICTED props — same pre-existing pattern as `sv_prop_collision` (CVAR_SERVERINFO cvars are NOT auto-synced to the client's local cvar; a listen server shares one cvar → immune; proper fix = read the synced serverinfo on the client, a separate hardening that would fix both cvars). (b) internal-node concavity hulls are ZG_Malloc'd then discarded on split → bounded one-time memgroup waste (≤ tree size, freed on unload, tens of KB for simple props) — a transient-hull refactor is the fix; deferred (LOW). **Dismissed:** index-width (16/32-bit) divergence + index validation (both pre-existing, not introduced).

**Build/deploy:** `gl_model.h`+`com_mesh.c`+`world.c`+`pmovetst.c` → rebuild both. **Verify** (`sv_prop_collision 3` + `sv_prop_decomp 1` + reload): hollow pipe → enter the bore (solid at decomp 0); one-piece arch → walk under; van → no regression; predicted prop no rubber-band; `r_showhull` shows ACD pieces carving the opening, `hulls=N ≤ 64`; toggling the cull gives identical endpos/fraction.

### Phase B — offline bake (`sv_prop_decomp 2`)
For A/B against a best-quality decomposition. `tools/acd_bake.py` (Python; `pip install coacd numpy`) parses an IQM, runs **CoACD**, and writes a `<model>.acd` sidecar = the PARTITION only (per-piece vertex sets, model space; little-endian `FCAD`/ver1/numpieces/[numverts,xyz...]). The engine `Mod_LoadACDSidecar` ([common/com_mesh.c]) loads it and builds each piece with the SAME `Mod_BuildConvHull` (bevels + conservative push-out) as the runtime path — so offline vs runtime differ ONLY in the partition (fair A/B). Loaded from the gamedir on both client+server → deterministic/lockstep (same `sv_prop_decomp` consistency caveat as Phase A). Missing/invalid/truncated sidecar → falls back to the runtime ACD. **Phase-B review (3 agents):** 1 confirmed (medium) — a 32-bit `(size_t)nv*12` overflow let a hostile `.acd` bypass the vertex-block bounds check (OOB read on 32-bit builds) → fixed with a division-based check + a hard `nv` cap (64-bit was never affected); all other parse/format/leak/API checks clean, tool↔loader format byte-matches.

**Build/deploy (B):** `com_mesh.c` → rebuild both; `tools/acd_bake.py`. **Verify:** `python tools/acd_bake.py models/.../pipe.iqm` → `pipe.acd`; `sv_prop_decomp 2` + reload → the prop uses the CoACD partition; A/B vs `1` with `r_showhull` + collision feel; predicted prop no rubber-band; delete/corrupt the `.acd` → clean fall back to runtime ACD.

## Patch 66 — `r_showhull` line batch: `MAX_INDICIES` guard (high-piece props drew no wireframe)  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

`r_showhull 1/2` drew **nothing** for props with many decomposition pieces (van 26 pc, mega sofa, parts of the wood pallet) while simple props drew fine. `CLQ1_DrawLine` ([client/cl_ents.c] ~2764) appends every hull-viz line into ONE `scenetris` batch keyed only on `shader`+`flags` — but, unlike its siblings (`CLQ1_AddSpriteQuad` `numvert+4<=MAX_INDICIES`, `CLQ1_AddBox` `+8<=`), it **omitted the `MAX_INDICIES` room check**. With a 16-bit `index_t` (`MAX_INDICIES`=65535) a high-piece prop's lines (pieces × tris × 3 edges × 2 verts) overflow 65535 in one batch; the relative index `cl_numstrisvert - t->firstvert` wraps → garbage/dropped → the whole prop's wireframe vanishes.

- **Fix (1 line):** add `&& cl_stris[cl_numstris-1].numvert + 2 <= MAX_INDICIES` to the batch-reuse condition so a new `scenetris` batch starts before the cap. Pure debug-viz — collision (`World_HullTrace`) was never affected.

**Build/deploy:** `cl_ents.c` → `m-rel` (`fteqw64.exe`) only; server binary unchanged. **Verify:** `r_showhull 1` now draws the van/sofa/wood-pallet pieces fully.

## Patch 67 — ODE prop sim shape: low-poly collision HULL instead of the render mesh (+resting-prop dCollide skip)  *(APPLIED, `world.c` m-rel+sv-rel + ODE plugin)*

12 `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` physics props cost ~22ms/frame: `World_ODE_BodyFromEntity` built each ODE body geom with `dCreateTriMesh` from the **full render mesh** (thousands of tris), and `dCollide` trimesh-vs-world is O(tris) × `physics_ode_iterationsperframe` (=4)/frame × 12. The PLAYER + bullet collision is a SEPARATE path (`World_HullTrace`, `sv_prop_collision`) that already uses the cheap convex hull/decomposition — only the ODE *simulation* shape was heavy. QC profiling confirmed QC (<1%) and player-trace (<1ms, Patch 65 per-piece cull) are not the cost.

- **Hull collision mesh** ([server/world.c] new `GenerateCollisionMesh_Hull`, dispatched from `World_GenerateCollisionMesh`): build the ODE trimesh from the model's `convhulls[].tris` (decomposition) else `hulltris` (single hull) — the same low-poly tris `r_showhull` draws (tens, not thousands). Mirrors `GenerateCollisionMesh_Alias` (BZ_Malloc on the ENGINE heap — the ODE plugin's `BZ_Malloc` is plain `malloc`, so this MUST live engine-side or `World_ReleaseCollisionMesh`'s `BZ_Free` mismatches; geomcenter-subtracted; `CollisionMesh_CleanupMesh`). The stored hull tris carry no ODE-guaranteed winding, so each tri is oriented OUTWARD by its convex piece's AABB centre (`n·(centroid−centre)≥0` keep else flip) → ODE gets correct face normals for stable resting (matches the render path's flip-to-outward).
- **Cvar `physics_ode_trimesh_from_hull`** (registered by the ODE plugin, read at body build / model load — reload to apply): `0` full render mesh (old), **`1` low-poly hull/decomposition (DEFAULT)**, `2` box. world.c reads it via `Cvar_Get` (shared cvar; plugin registers first at `World_ODE_Init`). `2` is handled plugin-side (a `dCreateBox` short-circuit at the top of `case GEOMTYPE_TRIMESH`).
- **Resting-prop skip** ([common/com_phys_ode.c] `nearCallback`, cvar `physics_ode_restingskip` default 1): a settled (auto-disabled) prop vs the static world (exactly ONE body) can't newly interact, so skip the O(tris) `dCollide` — fixes the constant ~40fps even at rest (auto-disable stopped the integrate/solve but NOT the broadphase collide). Single-body only, so a falling body landing on a resting prop is a body-vs-body pair (not skipped) whose contact joint still re-wakes it. Wired `dBodyIsEnabled` into the ODE_DYNAMIC prototype/loader (`-DODE_STATIC` build uses the real ode.h symbol).

No QC change — props keep `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH`. **Build/deploy:** `world.c` → `m-rel`+`sv-rel`; `com_phys_ode.c` → ODE plugin (`make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=ode`; the post-link `EMBEDMETA` zip step is absent here and not required — the shipped plugin never had it). Deploy `fteqw64.exe`+`fteqwsv64.exe`+`fteplug_ode_x64.dll`. **Verify:** 12 props recover toward baseline FPS; props still tumble/stack realistically + settle; resting scene ~0 cost; player collides with the exact hull (`r_showhull`, no sink/rubber-band); bullets hit the exact mesh; `physics_ode_trimesh_from_hull 2`=box (cheaper, box tumble), `0`=old slow trimesh (A/B; reload between).

## Patch 68 — ODE body = single convex hull (not decomposition soup) + settled prop-vs-prop dCollide skip  *(APPLIED, `world.c` m-rel+sv-rel + ODE plugin)*

A gravity-gun blackhole that sucks props into a tight pile dropped to ~30fps (from 300-400) and spammed `Trimesh-trimesh contact hash table bucket overflow [collision_trimesh_trimesh.cpp]`. Root cause: Patch 67's `GenerateCollisionMesh_Hull` preferred the convex **DECOMPOSITION** (`convhulls[].tris`, a SOUP of N pieces with internal/overlapping faces, ~120 tris) for the ODE body. For ODE **trimesh-vs-trimesh** between piled props that soup generates a huge number of close contacts (the bucket overflow) and an O(n²)-pairs × tris² narrowphase. The player/bullet path (`World_HullTrace`) is unaffected by everything here.

- **Single convex hull for the ODE body** ([server/world.c] `GenerateCollisionMesh_Hull`): default to `mod->hulltris` (one clean convex shell, ~12 tris, **always** built for IQM alongside the decomposition — com_mesh.c IQM loader) instead of `convhulls[]`. Gated by new cvar **`physics_ode_use_decomp`** (default `0`=single hull, `1`=old decomposition soup), registered in the ODE plugin, read in world.c via `Cvar_Get` (same shared-cvar pattern as `physics_ode_trimesh_from_hull`). The winding/centroid-orient build is unchanged (now `numgroups=1`, group = the single hull). ~10× fewer tris/pair → kills the bucket overflow and the pile cost. Player collision unchanged (`World_HullTrace` still uses `convhulls` per `sv_prop_collision 3`).
- **Settled prop-vs-prop skip** ([common/com_phys_ode.c] `nearCallback`): extends the Patch 67 resting-skip with a 3rd clause `(b1 && b2 && !dBodyIsEnabled(b1) && !dBodyIsEnabled(b2))` → two auto-disabled props don't re-`dCollide` each other, so a SETTLED pile costs ~0. Safe: two sleeping bodies can't move each other; an external awake body is an (awake,disabled) pair (not skipped) that still wakes them (`physics_addforce` calls `dBodyEnable`, so a pushed prop is enabled before the next step).

**QC companions this round (not engine):** melee weapons added to `wep_bypasses_cs_notify` (server runs the swing so `PhysProp_TryPushFromTrace` shoves props); a gravgun pull **deadzone** (`sv_gravgun_rest_radius`/`_speed`) so the settled pile core auto-disables → the skip frees it even while the blackhole is held; `data/server.cfg` pins `sv_prop_collision 3` + `sv_prop_decomp 2` + `physics_ode_trimesh_from_hull 1`.

**Build/deploy:** `world.c` → `m-rel`+`sv-rel`; `com_phys_ode.c` → ODE plugin. **Verify:** gravgun-suck a pile + hold still → FPS recovers (single hull) and goes ~free once settled (skip + deadzone); no bucket-overflow spam; player collision still exact. A/B `physics_ode_use_decomp 1` (old soup, slow) vs `0` (reload between).

## Patch 69 — `r_showhull` near-player distance cull (distant props' hulls stopped drawing)  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

With many props on screen, `r_showhull 1/2` stopped drawing distant props' collision hulls. `CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls` ([client/cl_ents.c]) iterates ALL world edicts with **no** distance/PVS cull and appends every hull's lines into the (unbounded but practically GPU/memory-capped) scenetris LINE buffer; once enough props pile in, the near hulls drop too. (Patch 66 fixed the per-batch 16-bit index wrap; this is the aggregate-volume problem.)

- **Fix:** in `CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls`, after the per-prop model check, skip a prop whose origin is farther than `r_showhull_maxdist` from `r_refdef.vieworg` (squared compare, no sqrt). New cvar `r_showhull_maxdist` ([client/renderer.c], `CVARFD` next to `r_showhull`, default **`1024`**, `0` = unlimited/old behaviour, `CVAR_CHEAT`). Placed before the per-prop diag print so it also cuts console spam. Debug-viz ONLY — collision (`Get_CModel` hull, `World_HullTrace`) is unaffected.

**Build/deploy:** `cl_ents.c`+`renderer.c` → `m-rel` (`fteqw64.exe`) only. **Verify:** in a prop-dense scene, near hulls draw, distant ones cull at `r_showhull_maxdist`; raise it (or `0`) to see more.

> **QC build note (not engine):** `data/server.cfg` is auto-generated from `shared/sh_cvar_table.qc`, which compiles into qwprogs + csprogs **+ menu.dat**; the Create Server menu regenerates server.cfg from the MENU VM. `compile_qc.bat` historically built only qwprogs+csprogs, so new `CVar_AddSaved` rows never reached the menu's table ("my cvars don't show up after recompiling"). Fixed by adding `fteqcc64.exe m_progs.src -max_strings 8388608` to compile_qc.bat. (Watch the .bat encoding — an em-dash/curly-quote in a REM comment made cmd error `"— was unexpected at this time"`; keep it pure ASCII.)

## Patch 70 — ODE collision mesh honors entity `scale` (scaled prop_physics no longer floats/sits-as-1.0)  *(APPLIED, `world.c` m-rel+sv-rel)*

A `prop_physics` with `scale 0.8` rendered + player-collided at 0.8 (CSQC mirror scale + `World_HullTrace` already read `entity.scale`) but RESTED/tumbled as a 1.0 body — the ODE rigid-body trimesh GEOM was built unscaled. `World_ODE_BodyFromEntity` (com_phys_ode) scales the AABB/mass/`geomcenter`/offsetmatrix by `scale`, but the GEOM verts came from `GenerateCollisionMesh_*` ([server/world.c]) in raw MODEL space with only the (already-scaled) `geomcenter` subtracted → a mis-sized + mis-centred shell, so a 0.8 prop floated ~3qu.

- **Fix:** in `GenerateCollisionMesh_Hull` (and `_Alias`) store `vert*sc − geomcenter` where `sc = ed->xv->scale` (clamped >0) — scale the verts BEFORE subtracting the scaled geomcenter, so the shell lands in the same scaled frame as the AABB/mass/offset and matches the player hull (`World_HullTrace` scales planes by the same `scale`). In `_Hull` the outward-winding `DotProduct` test stays on the UNSCALED verts (uniform positive scale preserves the sign — only the stored verts scale). `_BSP` left unchanged (brush ents don't meaningfully scale; avoids any brush-collision change).

No ODE plugin change. **Build/deploy:** `world.c` → `m-rel` + `sv-rel`. **Verify:** a `prop_physics "scale" "0.8"` IQM sits ON the ground (not floating) and rests/tumbles at 0.8; `r_showhull` + render + collision all 0.8.

> **QC companions (Round 16, not engine):** the prop's `scale` is now NETWORKED — `phys_files_Send` `WriteCoord(self.scale)` after the istrimesh byte + `CSQC_PhysProp_Update` `readcoord()` at the matching wire position + `self.scale=(sc>0)?sc:1` (mirrors `prop_static`; fixes the render-at-1.0). `Props_SpawnPhysics` `setsize` now scales mins/maxs by scale (broadphase + networked box + ODE box). And a **carry wall-deadband** (`Carry_Tick`, cvar `sv_carry_wall_deadband` "2"): when a carried prop's clip-slid hold is clamped against a wall, the into-wall component of the velocity servo is projected out so the server body RESTS at the wall instead of oscillating — killing the `r_showhull 1` jitter vs the steady client-predicted visual.

## Patch 71 — (QC-ONLY, no engine change) carried-prop collision tracks the visual

Round 17 is QuakeC-only (`server/sv_physprop.qc`), listed here only to keep the patch numbering contiguous. The carried prop's server collision hull TRAILED the client-predicted visual (and could disconnect behind a wall on a fast pickup-swing) because `Carry_Tick`'s velocity servo was capped by `sv_carry_max_speed` (~15.6 qu/frame @64Hz) while the client prediction has no cap. Fix: gate the cap on `hit_surface` — in OPEN space (clip-slide path clear) the servo is UNCAPPED (`desired=delta/ft`) so the ODE body reaches the clip-slid hold this frame (~1:1 on a listen server; remote clients keep a ping/2 floor). Tunnel-safe (clip-slide wall-clamps the hold; ODE `physics_ode_movelimit` caps per-step move). Drop-fling guard: `Carry_Drop` clamps the released velocity to `sv_carry_max_speed`, and `Carry_Throw` was reordered (drop first, then set throw velocity + re-baseline `pp_prev_velocity`) so the gravgun throw isn't clamped. No `.dat`-external change; recompile qwprogs.

## Patch 72 — per-pixel lightmap on adddecal() decals (`r_decal_lightmap`)

Make `adddecal()` decals sample the underlying world surface's LIGHTMAP per-pixel (lit like the surface), gated by `r_decal_lightmap` "0" (r_part.c). **Adddecal path only** (the nettest mod's `r_*_renderer 0`); **Q1/HL world** (`fromgame==fg_quake||fg_halflife`; else page=-1 → renders as today). GL backend. Runtime-cheap (one lightmap sample/pixel, like any wall). Default 0 = byte-identical to before.
- **lmst:** BARYCENTRICALLY interpolate the surface's ALREADY-FINAL atlased coords `surf->mesh->lmst_array[0]` at each clipped fragment (do NOT re-derive the analytic formula — `Mod_Batches_*` `lmmerge` atlasing remaps it). Page = `surf->sbatch->lightmap[0]` (exact backend index). `DecalLM_Interp`/`_Bary`/`_PickAxes` in cl_ents.c.
- **surf → callback (ABI-safe):** file-scope `const msurface_t *Mod_Decal_CurrentSurface` (q1bsp.c) set right before each `dec->callback` in `Fragment_ClipPoly`; `Fragment_Mesh` gained a `surf` param (+4 call sites); `extern` in gl_model.h. Read in `CL_AddDecal_Callback`.
- **page-split:** `scenetris_t` gained `int lightmap` (client.h); `CL_AddDecal` lazy-opens strips per lightmap page IN the callback (deleted the pre-open + rollback), so a decal straddling atlas pages splits into per-page strips. Parallel `vec2_t *cl_strisvertlm` (client.h decl + `cl_stris_ExpandVerts` grow; cl_main.c def; r_2d.c free). `BE_GenPolyBatches` sets `b->lightmap[0]=cl_stris[i].lightmap` and `R_DB_Poly` sets `mesh.lmst_array[0]` (every call — static mesh) — BOTH **gated on `shader->flags & SHADER_HASLIGHTMAP`** so the ~20 other scenetris producers (particles/beams/sprites, which don't set `.lightmap`) are unaffected without touching them.
- **shader:** a SEPARATE program shader (mod side) — NOT the shared decal shader (an `addtrisoup_simple` batch carries no lightmap page → a `$lightmap` stage there mis-reads one). Ships `nettest/glsl/decal_lightmap.glsl` (single pass `diffuse*lightmap*vertexcolour`, src-alpha — a 2-stage `dst_color*$lightmap` would darken the wall through the decal's transparent edges). QC registers `<tex>_lm` (program + `$lightmap`) and the adddecal draw uses it + WHITE vertex rgb when the cvar is on.

**TWO MORE ENGINE CHANGES were needed to make it actually render (the plumbing above was necessary but not sufficient — found via runtime probes; see memory `infodecal-renderer-trisoup`):**
- **gl_backend.c `BE_GenTempMeshVBO` — copy the lightmap texcoords.** This temp-VBO builder (used by scenetris/poly batches) had a literal `//FIXME: lightmaps` and copied `texcoord` from `m->st_array` but NEVER `m->lmst_array[0]` → the VBO's `lmcoord[0]` stayed NULL/stale → `v_lmcoord` read garbage. Added the copy in BOTH the streamvbo path (at the FIXME) AND the client-memory path (after the texcoord line), each with an `else` that NULLs `lmcoord[0]` (clears the pre-existing stale-pointer hazard for all other temp meshes).
- **gl_shader.c finalizer — don't lightmap-strip a program pass.** The vertex-light block at ~:5677 runs when `(r_vertexlight.value || !(s->usageflags & SUF_LIGHTMAP)) && !s->prog`. A runtime decal shader has no `SUF_LIGHTMAP` and no material-level `s->prog`, so with its `rgbgen vertex` (RGB_GEN_VERTEX_LIGHTING) the block COLLAPSED the 2-merged-pass program shader to 1 pass, DISCARDING the `$lightmap` pass (→ `s_t1` never bound = black). Added `&& !s->passes->prog` to the guard: a pass-level program that samples `$lightmap` uses it intentionally and must not be stripped/vertex-lit. (Also fixes the QC-side gotcha: `blendfunc`/`rgbgen`/`alphagen` must be written BEFORE the `map` lines in the program pass, else the blend lands on the last merged sub-pass while the backend applies the base pass's blend = opaque = the decal's masked magenta shows.)
- STATUS: **WORKING, user-confirmed on infodecals** (`r_decal_renderer 0` + `r_decal_lightmap 1` over a lit/shadow edge). Default 0 = byte-identical to before. GLSL has `r_decal_lightmap_debug` 0-7 diag modes + tunable `r_decal_lightmap_scale`. Sprays + bullet holes = same mod-side pattern (engine parts are global), pending.

## Patch 73 — Box3D physics backend plugin (`fteplug_box3d`, multicore prop physics)  *(APPLIED, NEW plugin — no existing engine .c changed)*

A second rigid-body physics backend alongside ODE, using **Box3D** (Erin Catto's C fork of Box2D; MIT; `C:\msys64\home\Lex\box3d-main`). It fills the same `rigidbodyengine_t` (world.h) as ODE and registers as `"Box3D"`, so `plug_load box3d` puts the server's props on Box3D instead of ODE. **The mod loads it by default** (sv_main.qc: `sv_physics_engine` selects `box3d` (default) or `ode`).

**This is a NEW plugin, not a patch to existing engine source** — nothing in the stock engine tree was edited, so an upstream pull needs no re-apply, only a plugin rebuild. Two new/edited files, both nettest-owned:
- **NEW `engine/common/com_phys_box3d.c`** — a 1:1 structural mirror of `com_phys_ode.c` with Box3D calls. Scope (v1): dynamic props → a convex HULL from the collision verts (`b3CreateHull`, ≤255 out-verts; Box3D has no dynamic trimesh — same limit as ODE `use_decomp 0`); static world/brush → a baked triangle mesh (`b3CreateMesh`+`b3CreateMeshShape`); box/sphere/capsule/cylinder primitives; the gravity-gun black hole (`RBECMD_FORCE`→`b3Body_ApplyForce(...,wake=true)`). **STUBBED:** skeletal ragdolls (all `Rag*` fns return false / no-op) and prop `.touch` events (props still collide physically). Player+bullet collision is unaffected (FTE's own `World_HullTrace`, never the physics engine — same as ODE).
- **`plugins/Makefile`** — a `box3d` target cloned from the ODE one (~:270), linking the prebuilt `libbox3d.a` (pure C — no libstdc++, no `-flto`).

**Key implementation notes (the bug-prone spots):**
- **Transform sync mirrors ODE exactly**, substituting a `b3Quat` for ODE's 3×4 rotation matrix: read = `forward/left/up = b3RotateVector(q, axisX/Y/Z)` then the SAME `offsetimatrix` fold + `VectorAngles`; write = `AngleVectorsFLU` + `offsetmatrix` fold then `b3MakeQuatFromMatrix({cx=forward,cy=left,cz=up})`. Verified: `b3MakeQuatFromMatrix` uses the standard column trace, so its columns are the images of X/Y/Z — identical to ODE's `dBodySetRotation` column convention (self-consistent inverse). The avelocity↔angular-velocity axis map (`[PITCH]=x,[YAW]=z,[ROLL]=y`) and the `r_meshpitch` alias-model sign are copied verbatim from ODE.
- **Multicore = Box3D's OWN internal scheduler** (native Win32 `CreateThread`), NOT FTE's worker pool: `b3WorldDef.workerCount = physics_box3d_threads` with `enqueueTask/finishTask left NULL`. Chosen deliberately — FTE's `WaitForCompletion` routes completion through WG_MAIN and doesn't per-item-signal from WG_LOADER, which fits coarse asset loads but not Box3D's fine per-step fork/join. Box3D's scheduler is purpose-built for this and avoids the deadlock/stall risk.
- **`ids are 8-byte value structs`** stored in the edict `void*` slots via `b3StoreBodyId`/`b3StoreShapeId` (0==null). Per-edict `b3CreateHull`/`b3CreateMesh` heap blobs live in `ed->rbe.geomdata` and are freed in `RemoveFromEntity` by their leading `uint64` version tag (`B3_MESH_VERSION` vs `B3_HULL_VERSION`) — the analogue of the ODE `dTriMeshData` leak fix (Patch 24). Density = `mass/volume` (Box3D derives inertia) so total mass ≈ QC `.mass`.
- **`cvar_r_meshpitch`/`cvar_r_meshroll` must be DEFINED** by the physics backend (mathlib.c's `VectorAngles(...,meshpitch)` references them as `r_meshpitch`/`r_meshroll`); this file defines + registers them like ODE does.

**cvars:** `physics_box3d_threads` (1=single, 2-8=multicore, live-resizable), `physics_box3d_substeps` (4), `physics_box3d_autodisable` (1=sleep settled), `physics_box3d_maxlinearspeed` (0=default), **`physics_box3d_unitscale` (40)**, `physics_box3d_debug` (0).

**CRITICAL unit-scale fix (else props are INERT):** Box3D — like Box2D — is metre-tuned; a global `b3_lengthUnitsPerMeter` (default 1.0) scales EVERY collision tolerance (`B3_LINEAR_SLOP=0.005×units`, `B3_SPECULATIVE_DISTANCE=0.02×units`, world `contactSpeed=3×units` push-out, `sleepThreshold=0.05×units`, `maxLinearSpeed=400×units`). At Quake scale (~40 units/metre, 64-unit props) they're ~40× too tight → contacts seen only within 0.02 QU + overlap resolved at 3 QU/s → props jam and never fall (look frozen). ODE has no unit concept so it works with raw QU. Fix: `World_Box3D_Start` calls `b3SetLengthUnitsPerMeter(physics_box3d_unitscale)` (default 40) BEFORE `b3CreateWorld`, rescaling all tolerances to Quake size at once. Gravity (800 QU/s²) + mass (`density=mass/geometric-volume`) are scale-independent, unchanged.

**Build/deploy:**
```
$env:MSYSTEM="UCRT64"
& C:\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe -lc "cd /home/Lex/fteqw/engine && make plugins-rel FTE_TARGET=win64 NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d"
# -> engine/release/fteplug_box3d_x64.dll ; copy to C:\FTEQuake\fteplug_box3d_x64.dll
```
The final `EMBEDMETA` (zip) step is optional package metadata; if `zip` is absent the DLL is already fully built + loadable. **Verify:** `plug_load box3d` prints "Box3D physics started (N worker threads…)"; a `prop_physics` crate rests stably on the floor (transform sync); `spawnflood <N>` (QC cheat) piles props; the gravity gun sucks them in; `physics_box3d_threads 1` vs `4` A/B under the flood shows the multicore win. Flip back with `sv_physics_engine ode`.

## Patch 74 — crepuscular god-rays: fix `r_renderscale`>1 misalignment  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

**File:** `engine/gl/gl_shadow.c` (`Sh_DrawCrepuscularLight`)  ·  search `r_renderscale>1`

**Why:** the crepuscular ("god ray") mask FBO was created at `vid.pixelwidth ×
vid.pixelheight` (the **window** size), but the 3D scene renders into
`r_refdef.pxrect` (= `vid.fbpwidth/fbpheight * r_renderscale`). With
`r_renderscale 2` the sky drawn into the mask lands in a mis-sized region and the
2D ray blit maps it back over the full screen offset/scaled — the rays appear
"view-locked", the visible skybox pieces are "way off" from the geometry, and the
whole field slides as you turn. At `r_renderscale 1` window==scene so it's fine.

**What it changes:** size the crepuscular texture + `GLBE_FBO_Update` to
`r_refdef.pxrect.width/height` (the actual scene render target) instead of
`vid.pixel*`, and re-`Image_Upload` when that size changes (static `crep_w/crep_h`
guard — mirrors the reflection FBO resize at `gl_backend.c` ~5362). Render path
otherwise unchanged.

**Companion gamedir shader overrides** (NOT engine source — live in
`C:\FTEQuake\nettest\glsl\`, so they survive upstream pulls automatically):
- `crepuscular_sky.glsl` — the stock mask shader assumes a Quake1 two-layer
  scrolling-cloud sky (`!!samps 2`), so a **skybox** renders garbage into the
  mask. Override = flat bright mask (draw sky surfaces via `ftetransform` as
  white); works for any sky type.
- `crepuscular_rays.glsl` — stock **hardcodes** the ray consts, so its `!!cvarf`
  did nothing. Override reads them as live cvars: `crep_weight` (intensity),
  `crep_decay` (shaft length), `crep_density` (reach). Colour/brightness stay on
  `r_sun_colour`; direction on `r_sun_dir`. Driven per-map by the QC `env_sun`
  entity (`nettest/src/server/sv_env_sun.qc`).

**Verify:** with `r_renderscale 2` + `r_sun_colour "1 .9 .7"` on a map with visible
sky, the shafts anchor to the actual sky openings (no offset). Rays legitimately
pivot around the sun's screen position as you turn — that's correct, not the bug.

---

## Patch 75 — crepuscular mask: exclude the first-person viewmodel occluder  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

**File:** `engine/gl/gl_backend.c` (`case BEM_CREPUSCULAR:` ~:4670)  ·  search `nettest: a first-person viewmodel`

**Why:** the crepuscular mask FBO is filled by `GLBE_SubmitMeshes`, which **always** submits entity
batches (`shaderstate.mbatches`, ~:5626) even though `Sh_DrawCrepuscularLight` passes only
`cl.worldmodel->batches`. So the **viewmodel** is drawn into the mask as a black occluder — but a
viewmodel uses the weapon-view matrix + `RF_DEPTHHACK` projection (the swap at ~:4240), which does
NOT map to its on-screen position in the world-space mask, so its shadow-silhouette lands at the
model origin (screen centre) instead of the drawn gun. World entities (players/props) use normal
transforms and are placed correctly — only depth-hacked/weapon overlays are wrong.

**What it changes:** at the top of `case BEM_CREPUSCULAR:`, skip the surface when
`shaderstate.curentity->flags & RF_DEPTHHACK` (`break;`). The viewmodel no longer casts a
mispositioned sun-shadow gap; it still occludes the composited rays via its own opaque pixels at the
correct position. Depends on Patch 74 (crepuscular renderscale fix).

**Verify:** `r_sun_colour "1 .9 .7"` on a sky map — the gun blocks the rays where the gun actually
is; no dark ray-gap floats at screen centre; players/props still cast correctly-placed ray-shadows.

---

## Patch 76 — crepuscular: gun cleanly blocks the rays (depth-gate the composite)  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

**File:** `engine/gl/gl_shadow.c` (`Sh_DrawCrepuscularLight`, the static fullscreen-quad `xyz[4]`)  ·  search `nettest: clip-space fullscreen quad`

**Why:** the first-person viewmodel is drawn in the OPAQUE pass (`gl_backend.c:6510`) BEFORE the
crepuscular composite (`Sh_DrawLights` :6519).  The composite is an ADDITIVE fullscreen quad, so the
rays add over the already-drawn gun -> the gun glows instead of blocking them.  (Patch 75 keeps the
gun out of the MASK so it casts no shadow-streaks, so it otherwise doesn't interact at all.)

**What it changes (two parts):** (1) the composite was NOT actually honouring depth test in that
draw state (blend-add left it indeterminate — it drew over everything), so it's now drawn with
**`BEF_FORCEDEPTHTEST`** so `GL_LEQUAL` really runs against the main scene depth (depth-write stays
off — buffer untouched, gun keeps its lighting since the composite just doesn't ADD there).  (2) the
fullscreen quad's clip-z is set each frame from a new archived cvar **`r_sun_occludedepth`** (default
0.2, window depth 0..1 → NDC), so the additive rays are rejected where the scene is NEARER than that
boundary (the near depth-hacked viewmodel) and pass over the farther scene.  Cvar (not a hardcoded
`-0.32`) because the exact viewmodel window-depth is uncertain — tune it live.  Builds on 74/75.

**Tuning `r_sun_occludedepth`:** raise if the gun still shows rays; lower if near walls stop glowing;
0 = rays over everything (old behaviour).  Caveat: viewmodel + world share the depth range, so
geometry nearer than the boundary also stops glowing — keep it as low as covers the gun.

**Verify:** `r_sun_colour "1 .9 .7"` on a sky map — the gun no longer glows; it blocks the rays at its
on-screen position; walls/floor/sky-openings still glow.  `r_sun_occludedepth` tunes the boundary.

---

## Patch 77 — Q1 (idBSP/HL) fog VOLUMES from `func_fogvolume` brush entities  *(APPLIED, client-render / `m-rel`)*

**File:** `engine/gl/gl_model.c` (`Mod_LoadQ1FogVolumes`, called in `Mod_LoadBrushModel` before
`Q1BSP_LoadBrushes`)  ·  search `nettest: Q1 (idBSP/HL) FOG VOLUMES`
**Also:** `gl/gl_shadow.c` `r_sun_occludedepth` default `0.2`→`0.65` (god-ray gun-occlusion, user-tuned).

**Why:** Q1 BSP has no Q3 fog lump, so `fogparms` fog brushes can't be authored on Q1 maps. But the
fog RENDER path is NOT `fromgame`-gated (`gl_backend.c:4930` `if(batch->fog && batch->fog->shader)`;
`surf->fog`→`batch->fog` at `gl_model.c:3102`; the fog-shader-resolve loop at `:5429`) — populate a
Q1 world model's `mod->fogs[]` + `surf->fog` and it fogs exactly like Q3.

**What it adds:** at Q1 map load (after submodels/planes/entities/faces, before the async
`ModBrush_LoadGLStuff` + `Mod_Batches_Generate`), scan `mod->entities_raw` for
`classname "func_fogvolume"` (COM_Parse loop like `R_ImportRTLights`), read `model "*N"` →
`mod->submodels[N].mins/maxs`, build a 6-plane axis-aligned `mfog_t` (mirrors `CModQ3_LoadFogs`) with
a runtime-synthesized `fogparms` shader (`R_RegisterShader(name,SUF_NONE,"{ fogparms (r g b) dist }")`
→ `Shader_FogParms` fills fog_color/fog_dist), and tag world surfaces whose CENTROID is inside the
volume (`surf->fog`). Entities inside a volume fog via the existing `Mod_FogForOrigin`
(`gl_alias.c:1863`, `#if Q3BSPS`). Keys: `rendercolor` (0-255) + `fogdist` (units).

**QC/FGD (mod, not engine):** `func_fogvolume` spawn stub (`nettest/src/server/sv_fogvolume.qc`,
`remove(self)` — client reads the BSP lump directly; server has no role) + FGD `@SolidClass`.

**v1 caveats:** AABB volumes only (not arbitrary brush shape); per-surface centroid test (coarse for
one huge floor spanning in/out); `visibleplane` is an approximation. Cap 64 volumes/map. Risk point:
the synthesized fog shader must survive the name-cache to the async `:5429` resolve loop or the fog
gets nulled (check `developer 1`).

**Verify:** map with a `func_fogvolume` brush (`rendercolor "160 170 190"`, `fogdist 384`) over a
room → surfaces + players inside fog; outside clear.

## Patch 78 — aspect-ratio (non-square) decals via optional `adddecal()` arg  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`)*

**Files:** `engine/client/cl_ents.c` (`CL_AddDecal`) + `engine/client/pr_csqc.c` (`PF_R_AddDecal` + its
forward decl)  ·  search `nettest: optional aspect`

**Why:** `adddecal()` (the `r_decal_renderer 0` path, plus bullet holes / sprays / scorch / blood) was
**square-only**: `CL_AddDecal` derived BOTH in-plane texture scales from the single `side` vector
(`scale[1]=scale[2]=1/radius`) and cross-produced the second in-plane axis, so width always == height.
Infodecals therefore couldn't keep a non-square PNG's proportions unless they used the tri-soup
renderer (`r_decal_renderer 1`) — but that path can't do the per-pixel decal lightmap (Patch 72), which
the mod pins on (`data/default.cfg`: `r_decal_renderer 0` + `r_decal_lightmap 1`). So per-pixel lightmap
and aspect ratio were mutually exclusive.

**What it adds:** an OPTIONAL 7th `adddecal()` argument `aspect` (= width/height; builtin #375). The
passed `side` vector still sets the vertical (T / `axis[2]`) half-extent = `radius`; the DERIVED
horizontal axis (`axis[1]` / S) is widened to `hradius = radius*aspect`, so `scale[1]=1/hradius`,
`offset[1]=…+0.5*hradius`. `aspect<=0` or absent → `1` = square. Fully backward-compatible: every
existing 6-arg caller (bullet holes, sprays, scorch, blood) is untouched and stays square
(`prinst->callargc > 6 ? G_FLOAT(OFS_PARM6) : 1`).

**TWO parts — texcoords AND the clip footprint (the second is easy to miss):** just widening the S
texcoord scale corrects the *texel* aspect but leaves the `Mod_ClipDecal` FOOTPRINT a square, so an
aspect-corrected texture **tiles** to fill the square (the texture uses `map` = GL_REPEAT, not
`clampmap`). `Mod_ClipDecal` (q1bsp.c:605) sets each clip slab's half-extent to
`length(tangent)*size/2` *after* normalizing the tangent to a plane normal — so pass **non-unit
tangents** to make the footprint rectangular WITHOUT touching the callback's texcoords (which use the
separate unit `ctx.axis[]`): `clipsize=max(radius,vradius)`,
`cliptan1=axis[1]*(hradius/clipsize)` (→ half-extent `hradius/2`, matches S∈[0,1]),
`cliptan2=axis[2]*(radius/clipsize)` (→ half-extent `radius/2`, matches T∈[0,1]), normal kept unit
(`dec.normal` for the back-face test unchanged; depth = `clipsize/2` = original). Footprint edge now
coincides exactly with the texcoord [0,1] range → no tiling, no stretch. For `aspect=1` with
`radius>=vradius` (all legacy callers, unit normal) it reduces to unit tangents + `size=radius` =
byte-identical to the pre-aspect call. **Adversarially verified** (3 lenses: clip geometry / texcoord
consistency / aspect=1 regression) against the real clipper before shipping.

**QC (mod, not engine):** `cl_defs.qc` builtin def gains `optional float aspect`; `cl_infodecal.qc`
stores `id_dec_aspect = half_w/half_h` (= pngW/pngH from `drawgetimagesize`) per adddecal slot and
passes it as the 7th arg on both the plain + `_lm` draw calls.

**Verify:** `r_decal_renderer 0` + `r_decal_lightmap 1`, place `{airgarden25` (512×128) → 4:1 rectangle
and still per-pixel lit; `{altar` (128×512) → 1:4; `{99store` (256×256) stays square; bullet holes/sprays
unchanged (still square).

## Patch 79 — PERSISTENT LIT DECALS: clip once + cache, kill the per-frame BSP re-clip  *(APPLIED, client-only / `m-rel`; Phase 1 = infodecals)*

**Files:** `engine/client/cl_ents.c` (store + persistent callback + `CL_ClipPersistDecal` + `CL_EmitPersistentDecals`
+ `CL_WipePersistentDecals`; Phase-0 refactor of `CL_AddDecal`/`CL_AddDecal_Callback` into `CL_Decal_SetupCtx`
+ `CL_Decal_VertexAttribs`) · `engine/client/pr_csqc.c` (`PF_R_AddDecalStatic`/`PF_R_RemoveDecal`/`PF_R_UpdateDecal`
+ table entries `#0` name-resolved) · `engine/client/client.h` (protos by the `cl_stris*` block) ·
`engine/client/r_surf.c` (emit hook after `P_DrawParticles`, both webostate + main branches, gated `!r_refdef.recurse`)
· `engine/client/cl_main.c` (`CL_WipePersistentDecals` in `CL_ClearState`). Search `nettest: PERSISTENT`.

**Why:** the QC re-issued `adddecal()` for every decal every frame (scene buffers wiped each frame in
`CL_ClearEntityLists`), and `CL_AddDecal` **unconditionally re-walks the BSP + re-clips** via `Mod_ClipDecal`.
So bullet holes (≤1024) + infodecals (≤128) — pinned to the `adddecal` path for the per-pixel lightmap
(Patch 72, `r_decal_lightmap` only works there) — cost O(N) BSP re-clips **per frame** → FPS falls with decal
count. FTE's native persistent decals (`clippeddecal_t`/particle udecal, `p_script.c`) clip once + re-copy each
frame but carry **no lightmap**. This adds the same clip-once-persist model **with** the lightmap.

**What it adds:** three CSQC builtins driving an engine persistent-decal store —
`float adddecal_static(shader, org, up, side, rgb, alpha, [aspect], [lifetime])` clips ONCE (reusing the exact
`CL_AddDecal` clip + `DecalLM_Interp` lightmap-coord code via the new shared `CL_Decal_SetupCtx`/`_VertexAttribs`),
caches the tris (`vertex/texcoord/lmcoord/valpha` + per-tri lightmap **page**) in a `persistdecal_t` record, and
returns a stale-safe handle (`(idx+1)|(seq<<8bits)`); `removedecal(h)` frees it; `updatedecal(h,rgb,alpha)` rewrites
color/alpha for **free** (fades, no re-clip — base rgba applied at emit, `valpha` edge-fade kept separate).
`CL_EmitPersistentDecals()` runs each frame in the world draw (before `BE_DrawWorld` consumes `cl_stris`, exactly
where the udecal `R_AddClippedDecal` emits) and re-copies each record's cached tris into the transient scene buffer
with lmcoord + per-tri page split → the existing `_lm` shader lights it, **no BSP clip**. Shaders are resolved BY
NAME (returns the QC-registered `_lm`; never fabricate → no checkerboard) and re-resolved + re-clipped lazily on
`r_regsequence` change (vid_restart / lightmap-atlas rebuild). Store wiped in `CL_ClearState` (map change / disconnect
/ CSQC restart). Clip runs on the main thread at spawn/epoch-rebuild only, so the `sh_shadowframe++` in `Mod_ClipDecal`
stays safe. ~0.6 MB at the 1024+128 caps.

**QC (mod, not engine):** `cl_defs.qc` gains the 3 `#0:name` builtin defs; `cl_infodecal.qc` adds a **new renderer
mode `r_decal_renderer 2`** (live-swappable): mode 2 reconciles an `id_dec_handle[]` per placed infodecal
(`adddecal_static` once, `-1` = off-surface don't-retry) and draws nothing (engine emits); modes 0/1 first
`removedecal` any leftover handles (no double-draw) then dispatch as before. Phase 0 refactor is byte-identical
(transient `adddecal` path unchanged). Phase 2 (bullet holes: `updatedecal` fades + handle eviction, static-world
holes) is the next step.

**Hardened (3-lens adversarial review before ship):** (1) **vid_restart use-after-free** — `r_regsequence` is
NOT bumped on renderer restart (only in `CL_ClearState:2295` + `sv_init`), so the `builtepoch` guard would miss it
and feed a dangling `rec->shader` to the backend → crash. Fix: `CL_PersistentDecals_Restarted()` (renderer.c:1952,
by the `CSQC_RendererRestarted` call) flags a re-resolve+re-clip on the next emit (which replaces `rec->shader`
BEFORE use). (2) **strip index overflow** — this build is 16-bit `index_t` (`MAX_INDICIES 0xffff`); persistent
decals accumulate into one merged strip, so `CL_Decal_OpenStrip` breaks the strip before `numvert+3 > MAX_INDICIES`.
(3) **slot-index cap** — the 16-bit handle index caps the store at `0xFFFE` live decals (`AllocSlot` returns -1 →
QC falls back to transient). (Refuted: the "non-byte-identical clip for |up|≠|side|" flag is Patch 78's intended
aspect behavior, and no caller passes `|up|<|side|`.)

**Verify:** `r_decal_renderer 2` + `r_decal_lightmap 1` on a wall of infodecals (or spam decals): FPS no longer falls
with count; `Mod_ClipDecal` fires only at spawn (not per frame); per-pixel lightmap identical to mode 0; A/B mode
`0`↔`2` pixel-matches; `vid_restart` / `map` / `disconnect` leave no leak/checkerboard/crash.

## Patch 80 — Box3D SKELETAL RAGDOLLS: implement the 8 stubbed `Rag*` backend functions  *(APPLIED, `fteplug_box3d` plugin — extends Patch 73)*

**File:** `engine/common/com_phys_box3d.c` (the 8 `Rag*` members of `rigidbodyengine_t` + a `Box3D_JointBasisQuat`
helper + a `B3RAGBODY` macro). Search `ragdoll`. Build/deploy = Patch 73's command (`make plugins-rel … NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d`).

**Why:** Patch 73 shipped the Box3D backend for props but left ragdolls STUBBED (`RagCreateBody`/`RagMatrixToBody`
`return false`, the rest no-op), so skeletal ragdolls (e.g. the mod's IQM player death-flop) only worked on ODE.
This un-stubs them so a `.doll`-defined ragdoll simulates on Box3D — its cone-twist spherical + limited revolute
joints are actually a better limb fit than ODE's limitless ball. Mirrors `com_phys_ode.c:1744-2042`.

**What it adds:** per doll-body a `b3_dynamicBody` + one primitive shape (SPHERE→b3Sphere, CAPSULE **and
CYLINDER**→b3Capsule — no faithful dynamic cylinder in Box3D, a capsule is fine for a limb; BOX→b3MakeBoxHull),
density=mass/volume (`b3Body_ApplyMassFromShapes`). Per doll-joint a Box3D joint by type: `JOINTTYPE_POINT`→
`b3CreateSphericalJoint` (cone/twist OFF = ODE-parity unlimited ball), `HINGE`→`b3CreateRevoluteJoint`
(enableLimit + lower/upperAngle from LoStop/HiStop, clamped ±0.99π; FMax→motor), `FIXED`→`b3CreateWeldJoint`
(rigid), `SLIDER`→`b3CreatePrismaticJoint`, UNIVERSAL/HINGE2→spherical fallback. **The real new work vs ODE:** ODE
sets a world anchor+axis directly, Box3D takes two LOCAL frames — so build one world joint frame (`wf.p`=anchor,
`wf.q`=`Box3D_JointBasisQuat(axis)` mapping the axis to the joint's frame z (revolute/spherical) or x (prismatic))
then `localFrameA/B = b3InvMulTransforms(bodyA/B_xf, wf)`. Transform sync reuses the prop FLU-column convention
(`Box3D_QuatFromFLU` / `b3RotateVector` on the row-major 3x4 `mat`). `collideConnected=false` per joint (jointed
pairs don't collide); bodies `b3DefaultFilter()` (collide static world + props + non-adjacent limbs). Ids pack into
the `rbebody_t`/`rbejoint_t` `void*` slots via `b3Store/LoadBodyId/ShapeId/JointId`. `RagEnableJoint(false)`
DESTROYS the joint (Box3D has no enable toggle; death ragdolls keep joints enabled).

**Caveats:** FTE ragdoll is `FTE_QC_RAGDOLL_WIP` (engine FIXMEs). Box3D joints are soft/springy — tune
`constraintHertz`. Needs a `.doll` def + QC `skel_ragupdate` glue (mod side) to actually flop a corpse.

**Verify:** NOT yet runtime-validated. Author a player `.doll` (`skel_generateragdoll <model>` template), spawn a
test ragdoll, confirm the bodies fall + REST on the floor (`physics_box3d_debug 1` awake-count/fall-Z; doll
`draw 1` wireframes). Open question: does the CSQC-world Box3D rbe have the static BSP (floor)? If not, run the
ragdoll server-side (server world has the mesh).

## Patch 81 — Ragdoll: fix `refpose` joint-anchor bug + `r_showragdoll` debug draw + entity-velocity seed (throwable)  *(APPLIED — extends Patch 80)*

Three ragdoll fixes discovered while runtime-validating Patch 80 (the CSQC leet ragdoll flopped but limbs looked
DISCONNECTED, there was no debug view, and it couldn't be thrown). Two build targets: A1/A2 are core engine
(`make m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64`), A3 is the physics plugins (`make plugins-rel FTE_TARGET=win64 NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d`,
and `…NATIVE_PLUGINS=ode` for parity).

**A1 — [UPSTREAM BUG FIX] joint anchor under a reference pose.** `engine/client/pr_skelobj.c` `rag_instanciate`
(joint loop, ~:1332). A `.doll` with `refpose skin` sets `refanim=-1` so the `absolutes` (reference-pose) path
runs. The loop computes the right pivot (`bone = j->bonepivot`) but the anchor `memcpy` indexed the wrong var:
`absolutes + 12*doll->body[i].bone` where `i` is the **joint** loop index → joint #i anchored at body #i's bone.
On the leet doll, 9 of 10 joints anchored **8–27 units** off their true pivot (shoulders at the head, right
shoulder across the body at the left forearm, hips at forearms…) → point joints pinned limbs at far-off points =
"disconnected/floppy". Fix: `absolutes + 12*bone` (== `j->bonepivot`), matching the non-refpose fallback at :1335
(`bones[j->bonepivot]`). The body-placement loop above (:1311) legitimately uses `doll->body[i].bone` because
there `i` IS the body index. **Backend-agnostic — fixes both Box3D and ODE, and every `refpose` doll.**

**A2 — [DEBUG] `r_showragdoll` cvar** (runtime debug-draw toggle). `engine/common/com_mesh.c` (declare next to
`r_skel_blendnormalize` :33, `Cvar_Register` :11690) + `extern` in `engine/client/pr_skelobj.c` :48. The doll
`draw` flags are baked at parse (no runtime toggle), so `rag_derive` gated the whole debug block + each body/joint
on them; relaxed all three gates to `|| r_showragdoll.ival` (:1385) / `&& !r_showragdoll.ival` (:1394 bodies,
:1437 joints). `r_showragdoll 1` force-draws every collision body (dark oriented box/sphere at the sim pose) + each
joint's anchor gizmo (cyan Z / yellow X). The joint gizmo sits at body-A's reconstructed constraint point, so a
mis-anchored joint (A1) shows as a gizmo away from where two limbs meet — the direct diagnostic.

**A3 — [THROW / Phase-3] seed ragdoll body velocity from the spawning entity.** `RagCreateBody` in
`engine/common/com_phys_box3d.c` (`World_Box3D_RagCreateBody`, after the create/zero `RagMatrixToBody`) **and**
`engine/common/com_phys_ode.c` (`World_ODE_RagCreateBody`) for parity. Stock code force-zeroes every limb's
velocity at create (`RagMatrixToBody` :1001-1002 / ODE :1760-1761) and, for a fully-limp (`animate 0`) body,
never re-poses it — so nothing QC-reachable could give a ragdoll initial motion. Now: if `ent` is non-NULL (the
model auto-path passes NULL) and it has non-zero `velocity`/`avelocity`, seed the limb's linear velocity from
`ent->v->velocity` and angular from `ent->v->avelocity` (QC deg/s Euler → physics spin axes via the same
`DEG2RAD(pitch), DEG2RAD(roll), DEG2RAD(yaw)` map the prop path uses at box3d:725 / ode:2399), then wake it. QC
recipe: set `.velocity`/`.avelocity` BEFORE `skel_ragupdate(e,"doll …",0)`. Enables the `throwragdoll` test and
is exactly what Phase-3 corpses need (seed from `victim.velocity`).

**Verify:** rebuild exe + box3d plugin, redeploy to `C:\FTEQuake`. `r_showragdoll 1` + `spawnragdoll` — joint
gizmos now sit AT the shoulders/elbows/hips/knees (not scattered at head/forearms) = A1 confirmed; limbs stay
connected. `throwragdoll` (tune `cl_ragdoll_throwspeed`) — the ragdoll flies in the aim direction and tumbles =
A3 confirmed. `r_showragdoll 0` hides the debug.

## Patch 82 — Ragdoll: throwable (velocity applied post-re-pose) + Box3D spherical cone/twist limits  *(APPLIED — extends Patch 81)*

Two ragdoll fixes found while tuning P81. **Rebuild exe AND both physics plugins together** — this adds a member
to `rigidbodyengine_t`, so the core + plugins must share the same `world.h` (member appended at struct END so
existing offsets don't shift → non-rebuilt map plugins like cod/hl2, which don't touch rbe, are unaffected).

**A1 — [THROW] `RagSetBodyVelocity`: apply the seed AFTER the re-pose loop.** The P81 seed in `RagCreateBody` was
DEAD: `rag_instanciate` (client/pr_skelobj.c) re-poses every body via `RagMatrixToBody` at :1359-1363 AFTER
`RagCreateBody`, and `RagMatrixToBody` zeros linear+angular velocity (com_phys_box3d.c:1001-1002 / ode:1760-1761)
— so a thrown ragdoll just dropped. Fix: a new rbe primitive `RagSetBodyVelocity(world, body, linvel, avel)`:
- `common/world.h` — appended to `rigidbodyengine_t` (struct end, ABI-safe). May be NULL (call-site guards it).
- `client/pr_skelobj.c` — after the re-pose loop (~:1365), if `ent` (auto-path passes NULL) has non-zero
  velocity/avelocity, remap avelocity QC-deg→physics-rad ONCE (`* M_PI/180`, PITCH/ROLL/YAW order — DEG2RAD is
  mathlib.c-local, not in scope; M_PI is) and call the setter per body. A limp (`animate 0`) body is never
  re-posed again so it persists; animated bodies get re-zeroed next frame by `rag_doallanimations` (correct).
- `com_phys_box3d.c` + `com_phys_ode.c` — implement `World_*_RagSetBodyVelocity` (SetLinear/AngularVelocity +
  SetAwake/dBodyEnable), register after `RagDestroyJoint`, and DELETE the now-dead P81 seed inside RagCreateBody
  (keep the `ent` param — still used for userData/GeomData). Bullet plugin: left NULL (not deployed).

**A2 — [LIMITS] Box3D spherical cone + twist (stop the free-spin).** All doll ball joints are `type point`, and
the POINT branch of `World_Box3D_RagCreateJoint` (com_phys_box3d.c:1224+) built a LIMITLESS `b3SphericalJointDef`
→ head dangled into the torso + spun forever, arms rotated forever. Now: when the doll authors stops, enable
Box3D's cone/twist (else stays a free ball → pre-limit dolls unchanged):
`if (HiStop>0){enableConeLimit; coneAngle=HiStop;}` (Box3D clamps ≤π/2), `if (LoStop2<HiStop2){enableTwistLimit;
lowerTwistAngle=LoStop2; upperTwistAngle=HiStop2;}`. Cone centres on frameA-z = the doll `axis` (mapped at :1177),
so author `axis` down the bone. HINGE already honoured LoStop/HiStop (P80), so elbows/knees are doll-only
(`type hinge` + axis + stops). ODE's ball has no cone/twist — ODE POINT stays unlimited (mod runs Box3D).

**Doll side (nettest, not engine):** `models/player/*/*.iqm.rag` — elbows/knees → `type hinge` (axis + LoStop 0
/HiStop ~2.6); shoulders/hips → point + `axis` down-bone + `HiStop 1.4` cone + `LoStop2/HiStop2 ±0.8` twist;
neck/waist → point + `axis 0 0 1` + `HiStop 0.6` + tight twist `±0.3`. Values tuned live via `r_showragdoll 1`.

**Verify:** rebuild exe + box3d + ode (`make m-rel` then `make plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d` / `=ode`),
redeploy all three. `throwragdoll` flies + tumbles; `r_showragdoll 1` shows the head no longer spins into the
torso and arms bend at the elbow instead of spinning. No csprogs change (throw = engine, limits = .rag assets).

---

## Patch 83 — Ragdoll debug: draw gizmos THROUGH the mesh + `r_ragdoll_timescale` slow-mo/freeze  *(APPLIED — exe only, extends Patch 81/82)*

Two doll-tuning aids. **EXE-only rebuild** (`make m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64`) — no `world.h`/physics-backend change,
so plugins are untouched. (The paired stuck-limb fix was doll-only: elbows/knees `type hinge`→cone `point` joints
in `*.iqm.rag`, because leet's near-straight bind pose makes an elbow hinge axis ill-conditioned + L/R
sign-flipped and `LoStop 0` pinned the knee at its bind bend — a spherical cone can't lock.)

**B1 — `nodepthtest` on the debug shaders (draw ON TOP of the model).** The `r_showragdoll` body/joint gizmos in
`rag_derive` (client/pr_skelobj.c) were occluded by the player mesh. Added `nodepthtest` inside the inner stage of
both inline shaders — `boneshader` (~:1416) + `lineshader` (~:1461). `nodepthtest` is the PER-STAGE keyword
(gl_shader.c:4254 → `SBITS_MISC_NODEPTHTEST` → `glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)` at gl_backend.c:3070); must be inside
the `{ }` stage (unlike `polygonoffset`, which is top-level). Now the gizmos render through the mesh.

**B2 — `r_ragdoll_timescale` (slow-mo / freeze the client ragdoll sim).** New cvar declared+registered in
`common/com_mesh.c` beside `r_showragdoll` (default `1`), `extern`'d in `client/pr_csqc.c`. Scales the dt of the
single CSQC-world step: `pr_csqc.c` (~:8824) now `RunFrame(&csqc_world, host_frametime * r_ragdoll_timescale.value
(clamped ≥0), 800)`. `physicstime` still advances by the full `host_frametime` (~:8830) so the accumulator never
spirals. `1`=normal, `0.1`=slow-mo, `0`=frozen (read-back + camera orbit still run → inspect a paused pose).
CSQC-only (menu ragdolls step a separate world), so default 1 is inert.

**Mesh ghosting (nettest QC, not engine):** `cl_ragdoll.qc` `CSQC_RagdollTest_Predraw` sets
`self.alpha = (cvar("r_showragdoll")>=2) ? 0.25 : 1` so `r_showragdoll 2` = through-drawn gizmos + a translucent
model (the gizmos are emitted by `skel_ragupdate` BEFORE `addentity`, so QC controls the mesh independently).

**Verify:** rebuild exe (only) + csprogs. `spawnragdoll` — elbows/knees droop freely (no half-bent lock).
`r_showragdoll 1` gizmos through the mesh; `2` ghosts the model. `r_ragdoll_timescale 0.1` slow-mo, `0` freeze.

---

## Patch 84 — Ragdoll: kill self-collision (it wouldn't collapse) + bone-local body `offset` (end-to-end limbs)  *(APPLIED — exe + box3d plugin)*

Two fixes so the ragdoll behaves like one. Rebuild **exe** (Part B, pr_skelobj.c) + **box3d plugin** (Part A,
com_phys_box3d.c); ODE untouched (already correct).

**A — [COLLAPSE] no ragdoll SELF-collision (per-doll negative groupIndex).** `World_Box3D_RagCreateBody`
(com_phys_box3d.c ~:1024) used `b3DefaultFilter()` (groupIndex 0), so a ragdoll's own NON-adjacent limbs collided
with each other (only the 11 joint-connected pairs were exempt via `collideConnected=false`). At the standing
spawn pose the two thigh boxes overlap at the crotch + forearms overlap the torso → contact push-out fires every
frame and props the doll up in a jittery "sitting" pose instead of collapsing (looked like "gravity isn't even").
**Regression from ODE**, whose near-callback skips same-doll pairs (`ed1==ed2`, non-solid owner → return,
com_phys_ode.c:2645-2680). Fix = Box3D's documented ragdoll pattern: `sd.filter.groupIndex = -(1 +
NUM_FOR_EDICT(world->progs, ent))` when `ent` — all of one doll's bodies share `ent` → same negative group →
never self-collide; a negative-group shape vs group-0 (static world / props / OTHER dolls, different ent → diff
group) still collides. Restores ODE parity; keeps ragdoll-vs-world + ragdoll-vs-ragdoll collision.

**B — [END-TO-END] body `offset` is now BONE-LOCAL, not model-space.** `rag_genbodymatrix` (pr_skelobj.c:1234)
left-multiplied `relmatrix` (`relmatrix ⊗ bonematrix`) → the offset was a fixed MODEL-space translation that only
aligned at the spawn pose and DETACHED from the limb as it rotated (so the collision box never tracked the
segment). Changed to `bmat ⊗ relmatrix` (bmat OUTER → `origin = B·t + b`, `t` along the bone's local axes,
rotates with the body); mirrored the inverse in `rag_derive` (:1500-1505): `(invemat ⊗ body) ⊗ inverserelmatrix`
(inverse on the RIGHT) so genbody↔derive stay exact inverses and the bone/skin still pins to the joint. Scoped to
`isoffset` bodies (our doll is the only user). Now a uniform doll `offset <dims0/2> 0 0` (local-X = down the bone,
same L/R) makes each limb box span bone→child end-to-end in EVERY pose, pivoting at the joint. Doll side
(`*.iqm.rag`): the 8 limb bodies use `offset 5/5.5/8/7.5 0 0` (= half of dims[0] 10/11/16/15).

**Verify:** rebuild exe + box3d plugin, redeploy both. Fully restart (reloads exe + doll cache). `spawnragdoll` —
collapses into a limp HEAP (no sitting/jitter). `r_showragdoll 1` — limb boxes span each segment end-to-end and
stay on the limb as it tumbles. Different ragdolls still collide with each other + the world. No csprogs change.

---

## Patch 85 — Ragdoll: bake joints against the OFFSET bodies (fix "pivot at box centre / floppy")  *(APPLIED — exe only, fixes P84-B)*

P84-B offset the limb bodies end-to-end, but the joint anchors ended up at the box CENTRE (elbow/knee very
floppy). Cause: in `rag_instanciate` (client/pr_skelobj.c) the bodies are created at the UN-offset bone (:1315),
the joints are baked next (`RagCreateJoint`/`b3InvMulTransforms` stores the anchor relative to the body's
transform AT THAT MOMENT, :1356), and only THEN are the bodies re-posed WITH the offset (:1363-1367). So each
baked anchor rides its body to the offset position → box centre; a shared elbow/knee pivot bakes two divergent
anchors → built-in slack. Buggy anchor = `E·B·R·B⁻¹·A_p` (stray `B·R·B⁻¹`). FIX: apply the same bone-local
offset (`bodymat = bodymat ⊗ relmatrix`) in the body-CREATION loop (~:1320, after the if/else, guarded on
`isoffset`) so joints bake against already-offset bodies; the `R` then cancels its own inverse at re-pose →
anchor = `E·B·A_b⁻¹·A_p`, the exact no-offset formula → lands at the pivot bone (box proximal end). Bodies stay
offset; skin/`rag_derive` + non-offset bodies (pelvis/chest/head) untouched. Verified by matrix algebra. Exe-only
rebuild; no plugin/doll/csprogs. Now the elbow/knee gizmos sit where two boxes meet, not mid-box.

---

## Patch 86 — Ragdoll polish: selective self-collision (forearm/calf vs torso) + limb damping (stop forever-sway)  *(APPLIED — box3d plugin only)*

Both in `World_Box3D_RagCreateBody` (com_phys_box3d.c). Rebuild **box3d plugin only** (`make plugins-rel
NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d`); no exe/doll/csprogs.

**A — [FOREARM THROUGH TORSO] selective self-collision.** P84 disabled ALL ragdoll self-collision (per-doll
negative group) to stop the propped-sitting jitter, but then the forearm/calf pass through the torso. With the
P84/85 end-to-end offsets, an OBB-SAT check found the ONLY remaining standing-spawn overlap is chest↔thigh (~2.4u
— the un-offset 16u chest box hangs into the thigh tops); forearm↔chest etc. are now separated. So: DISTAL bodies
(name contains `loarm`/`forearm`/`calf`/`shin`/`hand`/`foot` — `strstr` on `bodyinfo->name`, plugin can't link
core `Q_strcasestr`) stay in **group 0** → they collide with the torso; PROXIMAL bodies (pelvis/chest/head/
upperarm/thigh) keep the per-doll **negative group** → chest↔thigh never contacts → no re-prop. Box3D: same
negative group = never collide (wins); group0-vs-negative / different dolls / world = mask decides = collide.
Jointed neighbours never collide (collideConnected=false).

**B — [FOREVER-SWAY] limb damping.** Bodies were zero-damped (`b3DefaultBodyDef`) → frictionless pendulums (head
on the neck, hanging arms) whose ω never decays, so they never drop under the ~2 QU/s sleep threshold → never
sleep. Added `bd.angularDamping`/`bd.linearDamping` before `b3CreateBody`, driven by two new plugin cvars
`physics_box3d_ragdoll_angulardamp` (default **4**) / `_lineardamp` (default **0.4**) (decl ~:81, register ~:1370
via `cvarfuncs->GetNVFDG`). Damping is unitless (1/s, `exp(-c·t)`; does NOT scale with unitscale); angular ~4 →
envelope `exp(-2t)` settles ~1.5s, then the doll sleeps via the existing autosleep. Tunable live (lower =
livelier, higher = sluggish).

**Verify:** rebuild+redeploy box3d plugin, fully restart. `spawnragdoll`/`throwragdoll` — forearm/calf no longer
sink into the chest/pelvis; head + free arms settle in ~1-2s (no forever-sway) then sleep; still collapses to a
heap (no return of the sitting prop); other ragdolls still collide.

## Patch 87 — Ragdoll: fix teardown double-free CRASH (joints before bodies) + joint stiffness spring cvar  *(APPLIED — exe + box3d plugin)*

Rebuild **BOTH** `m-rel` (exe, the crash fix) and the **box3d plugin** (the guard + stiffness); no doll/csprogs.

**A — [CRASH on 2nd corpse retire] destroy ragdoll JOINTS before BODIES.** `rag_uninstanciate` (pr_skelobj.c,
~:1206) tore down bodies first, then joints. On the Box3D backend `World_Box3D_RagDestroyBody`→`b3DestroyBody`
**auto-destroys every joint still attached to that body** (Box2D-v3 core behaviour, undocumented in the port),
so the subsequent joint loop called `b3DestroyJoint` on already-freed joint ids → **double-free that corrupts the
shared Box3D joint pool**. It only faults later, when ANOTHER live ragdoll's joints in that pool are stepped by
`b3World_Step` — i.e. the nettest symptom "kill a bot, respawn, kill again → crash the instant the first corpse
is retired (`mp_deadbodies` cap) while the second ragdoll is live." (The `killragdolls` console cmd never
crashed because it frees everything with no `b3World_Step` interleaved, so the corrupted free-list is never
stepped.) **Fix: reorder the two loops in `rag_uninstanciate` so joints are destroyed FIRST, then bodies** —
safe for both backends (ODE tolerates either order; destroying a joint first unhooks it from its bodies so the
later body destroy has nothing left to auto-free). Defense-in-depth (box3d plugin): `World_Box3D_RagDestroyJoint`
(com_phys_box3d.c ~:1287) now guards `b3DestroyJoint` with `b3Joint_IsValid(id)` so any stale id is a no-op
instead of a pool-corrupting double-free.

**B — [TOO FLOPPY] optional ragdoll joint spring (stiffness).** The P86 damping cvars resist *velocity* (shorten
flailing, enable sleep) but don't restore a pose, so limbs still over-rotate wildly. Box3D's `b3SphericalJointDef`
(the doll's `type point` joints) exposes a rotational spring — `enableSpring`/`hertz`/`dampingRatio` with
`targetRotation` defaulting to identity (= the bind rest pose the joint frames were built in). Added two plugin
cvars `physics_box3d_ragdoll_stiffness` (spring Hz, default **2**; 0 = old free/floppy, ~6 = stiff mannequin) /
`physics_box3d_ragdoll_springdamp` (damping ratio, default **1** = critically damped, no ring) (decl ~:83,
register ~:1378). Applied in `World_Box3D_RagCreateJoint` (com_phys_box3d.c): when `stiffness>0`, set
`enableSpring`/`hertz`/`dampingRatio` on the spherical case (~:1272) and the revolute/hinge case (~:1225, with
`targetAngle=0`). The spring gently returns each limb toward its rest pose so the doll reads as a body, not a
rag; gravity still dominates the fall. Fixed/slider joints untouched. Live-tunable.

**Verify:** rebuild+redeploy exe + box3d plugin, fully restart. Body-shot a bot → ragdoll; respawn + kill again →
ragdolls AND **no crash** at the first-corpse retire; repeat + round restart → clean despawn. `spawnragdoll`
`physics_box3d_ragdoll_stiffness 2` → limbs noticeably less floppy but still fall naturally; sweep 0→6 live.

## Patch 88 — Ragdoll: `spawnpose reference` doll flag — build AT the reference pose (kills the "scrunch into the pelvis")  *(APPLIED — exe only)*

Exe-only (pr_skelobj.c). No plugin/csprogs (a doll-file keyword drives it).

**[SCRUNCH] initial joint-yank collapse.** `rag_instanciate` (pr_skelobj.c) creates the bodies + anchors every
joint (and bakes the P87 spring's rest) at the doll's **reference pose** (`refpose skin` → the model's skin/bind
pose = a wide T-pose), then the re-pose loop (~:1381) moves the bodies to `emat × sko->bonematrix` = the entity's
**frame-0 idle** pose. The two poses differ per-bone, so the previously-coincident joint anchors separate and the
solver yanks every limb toward the pelvis on the first steps = a "balled up" ragdoll. It's model-independent; the
mod's death corpse showed it clearly on bot kills (the local player's own was masked by the killcam-hide from P87,
hence the "scrunches when I kill a bot but not when a bot kills me" asymmetry). **Fix:** new opt-in doll keyword
`spawnpose reference` (parse ~:393 next to `refpose`; `qboolean spawnatref:1` on `doll_t` ~:61). When set,
`rag_instanciate`'s re-pose loop poses each body to `emat × absolutes[bone]` (+ the same bone-local offset the
create loop applied) instead of `rag_genbodymatrix` — i.e. it keeps the bodies AT the reference pose, just
transformed into world space. Because both bodies of a joint move by the SAME `emat`, their anchors stay
coincident → **no initial yank**, and the spring/cone/hinge limits (all baked at the reference pose) are correct
from frame 0. Default (no keyword) = stock behaviour (re-pose to the entity's current anim), so the auto-path and
other dolls are unchanged. Tradeoff: the doll now visibly STARTS in the skin pose (T-pose, arms out) for the ~1-3
frames before it flops — strictly better than balling up; to start from a natural idle instead, switch the doll to
`refpose 0 0` and re-derive the model-space joint axes for that pose (bigger, not done).

Mod side (nettest, not this repo): `models/player/*/*.iqm.rag` add `spawnpose reference`, and the elbows/knees
change from `type point` cones to `type hinge` (`axis` = flex axis perpendicular to the limb + a NEGATIVE `LoStop`
so "straight" is inside the range) for single-plane knee/elbow motion; `CSQC_SpawnCorpseRagdoll` calms the seeded
death tumble (avel 110→50).

**Verify:** rebuild+redeploy exe, re-copy the doll to all 11 model folders, fully restart. Kill a bot → the
ragdoll spreads + flops from the skin pose, no ball-up in the pelvis. `r_showragdoll 1` → knees/elbows bend in ONE
plane (tune the elbow `axis` if a forearm bends the wrong way). `spawnragdoll`/`throwragdoll` still clean.

## Patch 89 — Ragdoll: `spawnpose current` (start in the DEATH pose) + pose-independent joint axes  *(APPLIED — exe only)*

Exe-only (pr_skelobj.c). No plugin/csprogs (a doll keyword + the QC `skel_copybones` drive it). Extends P88.

**[T-POSE START → DEATH POSE] `spawnpose current`.** P88's `spawnpose reference` starts the ragdoll in the skin
T-pose facing yaw 0 — it "looks in the wrong direction and like a ragdoll just spawned" instead of continuing from
the pose/direction the player was shot in. New opt-in doll keyword `spawnpose current` (`doll_t.spawnatcur`, parse
~:407): `rag_instanciate` bakes the bodies (create matrix ~:1333) AND the joint anchors (worldmat ~:1360) at the
entity's **current** `sko->bonematrix` (the pose in the skeleton at instanciate time) instead of `absolutes`. The
re-pose loop is UNCHANGED — `spawnatcur` leaves `spawnatref` false, so it re-poses to `emat × sko->bonematrix` =
`emat ×` the create matrix; both bodies of a joint move by the same `emat` → anchors stay coincident → still no
yank, and the doll STARTS in that pose. The mod QC (`CSQC_RagdollSpawnAt`, cl_ragdoll.qc) clones the dying corpse
proxy's live skeleton into the ragdoll's skeleton via `skel_copybones(dst,src,0,0)` before `skel_ragupdate("doll")`
(at kill time the corpse still holds the last ALIVE rendered pose — mid-run, incl. the spine/aim deform), and sets
`r.angles = corpse.angles` (facing). Test spawns (no corpse) fall back to the default-pose `skel_build`.

**[AXES OFF THE REFERENCE POSE] rotate the joint axis by the pivot bone's ref→bake delta.** The joint `axis` is
authored in MODEL space and was only correct at the reference T-pose; at an arbitrary death pose the model-space
hinge/cone axis points the wrong way (elbow/knee would bend a skewed plane). At the axis-build site (~:1382), the
authored `j->axis`/`axis2` are now rotated by `delta = worldmat × inv(absolutes[pivot])` before `VectorNormalize2`
(`Matrix3x4_Invert_Simple` + `R_ConcatTransforms` + `Matrix3x4_RM_Transform3x3`). `worldmat` is the bake-pose pivot
matrix: for `spawnpose reference` it == `absolutes[pivot]` → **delta is IDENTITY → the authored axis is unchanged**
(so P88 ref-mode dolls keep their exact tuned behaviour), and for `spawnpose current` it's the death-pose matrix →
the axis tracks the bone and stays perpendicular to the limb. **This means the doll axes did NOT need re-authoring
to bone-local** — the model-space values (verified good at the T-pose) are made pose-independent by the engine.
Guarded on `absolutes` (falls back to the raw authored axis when no `refpose`). Assumes rigid (orthonormal) bind
bones (same assumption the existing `Matrix3x4_Invert_Simple` bone-matrix uses make).

Mod side (nettest): `models/player/*/*.iqm.rag` change `spawnpose reference` → `spawnpose current`; elbow hinges
`LoStop -0.2` → `-0.5` (more extension). `cl_ragdoll.qc` `CSQC_RagdollSpawnAt` gains a `posesrc` param (the corpse)
for the `skel_copybones` + `r.angles`.

**Verify:** rebuild+redeploy exe, re-copy the doll, fully restart. Kill a bot that's **running/strafing** → the
ragdoll continues from that pose, faces the right way, flops. `r_showragdoll 1` → knees/elbows still single-plane at
the death pose (if a hinge bends the wrong plane, flip that elbow `axis`). Arms extend straighter. `spawnragdoll`/
`throwragdoll` (default pose) unchanged. Caveat (deferred): the hinge limit zero is the death-pose angle, so a
limb that died bent measures its range from that bend — add a bind→current limit offset in `RagCreateJoint` only
if that reads wrong.

## Patch 90 — SERVER-side authoritative ragdolls: network ragdoll bones + a `impulse` dollcmd  *(APPLIED — exe (m-rel) + dedicated server (sv-rel))*

Two engine changes that let the SERVER own the death ragdoll (sim in `sv.world`, network the flop to every client,
be shootable) — the substrate (server rbe stepping, skel builtins, per-bone hitbox traces) already existed. Mod
side = new `server/sv_ragdoll.qc` (spawn-on-death, per-frame derive, SOLID on a `RAGDOLL_DIM` pass-through
dimension, lifecycle via `VisProxy_RetireCorpse`) + bullet-shove; the old client-side death ragdoll is disabled.

**A — [MANDATORY] network SKEL_ABSOLUTE (ragdoll) bones** — `server/sv_ents.c` UF_BONEDATA writer (~:3569). It only
emitted bones for `SKEL_RELATIVE` skeletons; a ragdoll skeleton is `SKEL_ABSOLUTE` (rag_derive leaves it absolute +
entity-local via `invemat`), so a server ragdoll's flopping bones were silently dropped → clients saw nothing. Added
a branch: when `SKEL_ABSOLUTE`, get the model's bone parents (`Mod_GetBoneInfo` via `sv.world.Get_CModel`), convert
absolute→relative into a temp buffer with `Alias_ForceConvertBoneData` (forward-declared locally — com_mesh.h isn't
in sv_ents.c's include chain, but merged.h gives skeltype_t/galiasbone_s/Mod_GetBoneInfo), then the existing
`Bones_To_PosQuat4`. **Client side UNCHANGED** (cl_ents.c already rebuilds relative bones → `rag_lerpdeltaent`).
Rebuild BOTH `m-rel` and `sv-rel` (server-side file). REQUIRES the QC set `.basebone = -1` on the ragdoll edict —
the whole block is gated on `basebone < 0` (sv_ents.c:3560). Correctness rests on ragdoll bones being entity-local.

**B — `impulse` / `impulsebody` dollcmd** — `client/pr_skelobj.c` `PF_skel_ragedit` (beside `animatebody`, ~:1900),
shared VM so both server + client get it. Wraps the existing (both-backend) `RagSetBodyVelocity` (com_phys_box3d.c /
com_phys_ode.c), previously only called by `rag_instanciate`. `impulse <vx vy vz>` sets EVERY body's velocity
(whole-doll shove/throw); `impulsebody <name> <v>` sets one body by `rag_finddollbody`. Guarded on the rbe fn ptr.
Used by the QC bullet-shove now + the Phase-2 gravity gun.

**Verify:** rebuild+redeploy exe + dedicated server + qwprogs + csprogs. Kill a bot on a listen server with a 2nd
client/spectator connected → BOTH see the same flop (proves A). Shoot a settled corpse → it shoves and the bullet
passes through to an enemy behind (RAGDOLL_DIM). Known Phase-1a gaps to finish next: the packet-entity ragdoll isn't
brightness-capped (`r_playermodels_maxlight`) or team-tinted; the animated corpse proxy still DOUBLE-DRAWS with the
ragdoll (needs a networked "hide mesh" proxy flag so the killcam can still re-pose it); and the ragdoll shows during
a local killcam replay (needs a cull).

## Patch 91 — Server ragdoll Phase-1b: brightness-cap + killcam-cull the packet-entity ragdoll  *(APPLIED — exe (m-rel) only)*

Two client-render touch-ups on the server ragdoll (a PACKET entity, so the QC render passes can't reach it), both
at `client/cl_ents.c` `CL_LinkPacketEntities` (~:5382, the existing `model->dollinfo || le->skeletalobject` ragdoll
detect — on a packet entity that's a server ragdoll: players are CSQC proxies, props have no bones, we never use
`.doll`). The **double-draw fix is QC-only** (a networked "hide the corpse mesh" proxy flag — no engine change).

**A — brightness cap.** `CSQC_ApplyTeamTints` only caps `player_visual_proxy` CSQC entities, so the packet ragdoll
blew out on bright floors. After `rag_updatedeltaent`, replicate the QC `CSQC_MaxlightScale` (cl_teamtint.qc):
`cl.worldmodel->funcs.LightPointValues(ent->origin, diffuse, ambient, dir)` → `getlight = diffuse + 0.5*ambient`
per channel → brightest → Reinhard rolloff toward `r_playermodels_maxlight` (soft knee `r_maxlight_softknee`, both
read via cached `Cvar_FindVar`, re-looked-up while NULL so QC-registration order doesn't matter) → scale all three
`ent->shaderRGBAf` channels + **set `ent->flags |= RF_FORCECOLOURMOD`** (else the scaled colormod isn't applied).

**B — killcam cull.** During a local killcam replay the present-time ragdoll must not show over the rewound scene.
deltalisten/CSQC drawmask can't filter packet entities, so: the mod sets client cvar `cl_killcam_hideragdolls`
(driven each frame from `Killcam_Active()` in CSQC_UpdateView); when set, cull the ragdoll here —
`cl_numvisedicts--; continue;` (un-commit the visedict added at :5204). Client-render only → **m-rel only** (no
sv-rel). Mod side: `.float vps_hide_ragdoll` networked at the END of the proxy `VP_SF_IDENTITY` section (one matched
byte each way, sv_player.qc + cl_player.qc) + the corpse predraw hides its mesh on it (except while the killcam
owns it), set/cleared in sv_ragdoll.qc's spawn/free.

**Verify:** rebuild+redeploy exe + qwprogs + csprogs. Kill a bot → ONE body (the ragdoll, no frozen death-anim
double). On a bright floor it's capped. Your own death → the killcam shows you alive (no present ragdoll over it);
after, the ragdoll is there. Repeated kills + round restart → clean.

## Patch 92 — Clamp the bone-position quantizer (fix the networked-ragdoll spawn "freak-out")  *(APPLIED — m-rel + sv-rel)*

`Bones_To_PosQuat4` (`common/mathlib.c:818-824`) — the UF_BONEDATA encoder — stored each RELATIVE bone position as
`pos*64` straight into a signed short with **no clamp** → range only ±511u (32767/64). A normal SKEL_RELATIVE anim's
child→parent offsets are bone lengths (~10-30u) so it never mattered, but a SERVER RAGDOLL (P90) whose joints
momentarily STRETCH past 511u under the violent death impulse produced a float→short **wrap** → the limb teleported
to the opposite side = a ~300-500ms "expand/distort" until the doll settled back under range and it snapped normal.
(The local CSQC test ragdolls render raw float matrices with no quantization, so they never showed it — the
quantizer was the amplifier.) **Fix: `bound(-32767, pos*64, 32767)` on the three position stores** so an overshoot
saturates (a graceful stretch-to-edge) instead of wrapping. `Bones_To_PosQuat4` runs in the SERVER snapshot writer
(`sv_ents.c`), so rebuild **both m-rel (listen) and sv-rel (dedicated)**.

Mod-side companion (P92, qwprogs, sv_ragdoll.qc `Ragdoll_Think`): the ragdoll edict had a FIXED 80×80×112 bbox pinned
to the death origin (never updated) → the bullet-shove traceline hit whichever oversized/overlapping box the ray
entered first = the WRONG doll ("shoot corpse A, corpse B jumps"). Now the think computes a TIGHT world AABB from the
live bones each frame (`gettaginfo(self,i)` over `skel_get_numbones`, `setsize` relative to the fixed origin) so each
box wraps its actual body — the shove hits the aimed doll and a slid body stays hittable.

**Verify:** rebuild m-rel+sv-rel+qwprogs. Kill a bot → the ragdoll flops cleanly from frame 0 (no expand/distort).
Two corpses near each other → shooting one moves only that one.

## Patch 93 — Multi fake shadows: per-light shadow projections in one atlas (r_shadows_fakecount)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

`r_shadows 2` renders ONE model-only ortho shadowmap from one global direction. This patch adds up to **8
simultaneous projections** — slot 0 stays the classic sun ortho (throwdirection), slots 1..N-1 are **spot
projections at real light positions** aimed straight down (QC feeds them via `r_shadows_fakelightN
"x y z radius"` from the map's light entities) — so every nearby lamp throws its own model shadow.

- `gl/gl_shadow.c` — new cvars `r_shadows_fakecount` (1..8, **CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM** so count changes flush
  shaders), `r_shadows_fakefov` (140), `r_shadows_fakelight1..7`. `Sh_GenShadowFace` gained an atlas-cell
  override (`sh_fakecell_*` statics). New `Sh_GenerateFakeShadowsAtlas(count)`: ONE `GLBE_BeginShadowMap`
  (it clears the WHOLE texture — per-light Begins would wipe earlier cells) then each valid slot renders
  models-only depth (face 4) into its cell of the SAME 2048² `shadowmap[2]` texture (2×2 cells ≤4 slots,
  3×3 above; cells inset 16px so PCF taps/edge-fade can't bleed). Slot consumption matrices are UNBIASED
  proj×view built in the FAKESHADOWS xyz convention (`ModelViewMatrixFromAxis(axis0, axis2, axis1)` — the
  ORTHO-branch pairing; spot slots swap only the projection half via `Projection_Far`). GL-only; count 1
  (default) = the untouched legacy single path.
- `gl/gl_backend.c` — `shaderstate.fakeshadowmatrix[8]/fakeshadowcell[8]/fakeshadowcount` +
  `GLBE_SetFakeShadowCount/Slot` (NULL slot = far-translate neutral matrix → shader early-outs). New
  uniform uploads `SP_FAKESHADOWMATRIX` (mat4 array, per-batch modelmatrix-composed) / `SP_FAKESHADOWCELL`
  (vec4 array).
- `gl/gl_shader.c` — uniform rows `l_fakeshadowmatrix[0]`/`l_fakeshadowcell[0]` (+ bare-name variants);
  the FAKESHADOWS define injection now also emits `#define FAKESHADOWS_COUNT %i`.
- `gl/shader.h` — SP enum + prototypes.
- **GLSL ships as a DISK OVERRIDE, not r_bishaders**: `nettest/glsl/defaultwall.glsl`
  (Shader_LoadGeneric loads filesystem programs before builtins). `FAKESHADOWS_COUNT>1` declares
  `l_fakeshadowmatrix[K]`/`l_fakeshadowcell[K]` + a varying array, loops K projections in the fragment:
  cell-local coord → edge-fade → atlas remap → 9-tap PCF; per-slot darkening 0.5·(1−s) SUMMED, clamped
  0.6 (single light identical to legacy s·0.5+0.5; overlaps read as umbra, never black). `#if
  FAKESHADOWS_COUNT < 2` keeps the legacy path verbatim (and old engines w/o the define fall back safely).
- Mod driver: `client/cl_maplights.qc` `MapLights_DriveFakeLights` (cl_lightshadow_perlight) assigns the
  nearest in-reach map lights to slots with 20%-closer hysteresis, change-gated cvar_set.
- BUILD NOTE: build from an MSYS2 UCRT64 **login shell** (`bash -lc`), NOT a plain shell — mixed
  git-bash/msys2 runtimes break make's temp files ("Cannot create temporary file in C:\WINDOWS").
- CRASH FIX (same day): the atlas loop MUST call `GLBE_SelectDLight` per slot before
  `Sh_GenShadowFace` — it sets `shaderstate.curdlight`, which the BEM_DEPTHONLY entity batching
  dereferences (`ent->keynum == dl->key`, gl_alias.c:3002). The first version skipped it (only
  the matrix seemed needed) → NULL curdlight → segfault on the first frame with visedicts,
  i.e. the moment a client spawns with r_shadows 2 + fakecount>1 active.
- NO-SHADOWS FIX (same day): `GL_ViewportUpdate` FLIPS pxrect.y (top-origin) to GL's bottom-origin
  (`maxheight-(y+height)`, glquake.h:423). The legacy single path centres its region symmetrically so
  the flip is invisible; asymmetric atlas cells sampled the EMPTY half of the texture -> depth 1.0 ->
  zero shadows at any fakecount>1. Fix: the cell uniform's v-offset is the region's BOTTOM edge:
  `cell.y = (txsize - (row*cellsize + inset + smsize))/txsize` (x maps straight through).
- **REDESIGN (spots → ortho-per-light, the fix that actually works):** the perspective spot
  projection (`Projection_Far`, aimed straight down from the light) never lined up with the
  FAKESHADOWS consumption shader — that shader + the whole atlas cell/viewport pipeline were built
  and tuned for the ORTHO sun's clip convention, so spots came out mirrored and tiny, and their
  non-linear perspective z made the edge-fade erase them (the "SPOT-FADE trap"). Replaced with:
  **every per-light slot is now an ORTHO projection whose throw direction = `normalize(boxCentre −
  lightOrg)`** (points from the lamp toward the casters). This reuses slot 0's exact matrices
  (`Matrix4x4_CM_Orthographic` + `ModelViewMatrixFromAxis(axis0,axis2,axis1)`), so it can't disagree
  with the shader; it also gives the physically-correct behaviour the user asked for — the shadow
  **swings away from the light and lengthens as the light drops toward the horizon**, recomputed every
  frame from the player's position (no `cl_lightshadow_swing` needed; that only steers slot 0). Box
  positioned by `Sh_OrthoAlignToFrustum` (view-centred, texel-snapped) at half-extent
  `r_shadows_fakelightsize` (new cvar, default 200 qu) — tight box = localised, high-res, only casters
  near the player fall in it, so distant lamps don't shadow you. The cvar's 4th component (radius) now
  only gates the slot on/off; box size is the cvar. `r_shadows_fakefov` is now dead (kept registered).
  Shader simplified: all slots ortho (w==1) → uniform z-included edge-fade, no perspective/spot
  special-casing. `LSHADER_SPOT` no longer used by the fake path (all `LSHADER_ORTHO`).
- **REDESIGN 2 (ortho-per-LIGHT → ortho-per-CASTER, the Source RTT model):** one ortho box per
  *light*, centred on the local player, still had a fatal flaw — an ortho projection has ONE parallel
  direction, so every model in that box cast along the SAME direction (derived from the local
  player), and the whole scene's shadows swung whenever the viewer moved (obvious under
  `spawnflood 100` + `fakelightsize 1200`). Point lights need a perspective projection, which doesn't
  fit the ortho-tuned shader. Fix = the same model Source uses for dynamic RTT shadows: **per-CASTER,
  not per-light.** Slots 1..N-1 now read `r_shadows_fakelightN "cx cy cz dx dy dz"` = a nearby
  *entity's* origin + its own dominant-light throw direction, both computed in QC
  (`MapLights_DriveCasterShadows` picks the nearest registered casters; `MapLights_DirAt` gives each
  one's direction). The engine parses 6 floats from `cv->string` (manual `strtod` loop — `cv->vec4`
  only does 4), centres the box on the caster origin (`Sh_OrthoAlignToPoint`, NOT the view — the last
  aim-dependence is gone), and keeps the angle-based auto-size + `pv[14] -= 2/radius` world-bias.
  Result: each entity gets ONE correct shadow aimed from its own light; **nothing shifts with the
  viewer.** Slot 0 unchanged (sun). `fakecount 1` = the plain single directional shadow. Ortho still
  can't do true point-light divergence, but per small caster the parallel approximation is ~exact and,
  crucially, lines up with the shader. Deferred: tight boxes isolate well-separated casters; dense
  clusters (spawnflood) could add a per-slot entnum filter in `BE_GenModelBatches`. QC:
  `client/cl_maplights.qc` (driver + `MapLights_RegisterShadowCaster`, fed from every `BlobShadow_Emit`
  site). `r_shadows_fakelightsize` is now the box **minimum** (auto-grows). `r_shadows_fakefov` dead.
- **REDESIGN 3 — per-caster RETIRED, model SELF-SHADOWS added (the actual shipping state; NO engine
  change, all in the mod).** Per-caster is fundamentally broken: only entities that call
  `BlobShadow_Emit` register as casters, but settled physics props unhook their predraw and
  `prop_static` scenery has no CSQC predraw at all — so static props never get a slot and are rendered
  into whatever moving caster's box covers them, sharing the *player's* angle. Not worth fixing
  (needs static registration + per-slot entnum isolation). So `fakecount 1` (single sun ortho) is the
  shipping shadow, and the mod now makes MODELS **receive** that sun depth map to self-shadow, via a
  disk-override shader `nettest/glsl/defaultskin.glsl` (copy of baked `shaders/glsl/defaultskin.glsl` +
  `!!permu FAKESHADOWS`/`!!samps =FAKESHADOWS shadowmap`/`ShadowmapFilter`, gated `FAKESHADOWS &&
  !TESS && FAKESHADOWS_COUNT<=1`). No C edit — `Shader_LoadGeneric` loads gamedir `glsl/*.glsl` first,
  and FAKESHADOWS/curshadowmap/l_cubematrix persist from `Sh_GenerateFakeShadows` into the forward
  pass. BIAS: `ShadowmapCoord`'s built-in 0.015 NDC z-bias is 0.015×radius WORLD units (~15qu at
  fakedistance 1024 → peter-pans a 32u model); the shader cancels it and uses a radius-independent
  normal-offset (`w += n*2qu`) instead — critical because caster==receiver here (unlike the world).
  Quality dial = `r_shadows_fakedistance` (lower = crisper self-shadow + world shadow, smaller
  coverage). Cvardf knobs `r_shadows_selfshadow`/`_floor`/`_nbias`.

## Patch 94 — Model-light black-sample fallback for ceiling/wall-mounted props (r_modellight_fallback)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

Model lighting for every non-viewmodel entity is sampled at **origin + 24qu up** (`R_CalcModelLighting`,
`gl/gl_alias.c` — a floor-item helper predating ceiling-mounted props), and `GLQ1BSP_LightPointValues`
casts its lightmap ray straight DOWN from that point. A prop_static hung under a roof (e.g. the mega
ceiling lamps, flipped over) puts origin+24 INSIDE the ceiling brush; the recursive lightpoint walk
starts in solid, returns NULL, and the model renders pure black.

- `gl/gl_alias.c` (`R_CalcModelLighting`, non-weaponmodel branch): after the standard +24 sample, if the
  result is fully black (all six ambient+shade channels 0 — the in-solid/NULL signature), retry the
  sample at origin, then origin−24, then origin−48, stopping at the first non-black result. Ceiling- and
  wall-mounted models thereby take the light of the open space they hang in. Floor-standing entities
  never trigger it (their first sample is lit), and a genuinely pitch-black room stays black (every rung
  returns 0 → unchanged). Cost: extra lightpoint traces only when the first sample is black.
- `client/renderer.c`: new cvar `r_modellight_fallback` (default **1**, CVAR_ARCHIVE) gating the ladder;
  0 = engine-default single sample.

Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact. Applies to all BSP formats (the ladder
re-calls `LightPointValues`, so Q1 lightmap walk, BSPX lightgrid, and Q3 lightgrid paths all benefit).

## Patch 95 — REMOVE the multi fake-shadow atlas (Patch 93's fakecount path) + `r_shadows_fakeres`  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

The Patch 93 multi-projection atlas is retired for good (user call: "remove the cvar and the
functionality — it no longer works").  It was already dead in practice: one ortho box carries ONE
light direction so every caster in it shared the local player's throw angle, and static/settled
props could never register per-caster slots (see the P93 REDESIGN 3 addendum).  The shipping look
is the SINGLE sun-aligned fake shadow (`r_shadows 2`) + `defaultskin.glsl` model self-shadows.

Removed (the single classic path is untouched — verified it never depended on any of this,
including the atlas-only `pv[14]` world bias; its bias lives in `sys/pcf.h`):
- `gl/gl_shadow.c`: cvars `r_shadows_fakecount`/`fakefov`/`fakelightsize`/`fakelight1..7` (+
  registrations), `Sh_GenerateFakeShadowsAtlas`, `Sh_OrthoAlignToPoint`, `r_fakelights[8]`,
  the `sh_fakecell_*` atlas-cell plumbing in `Sh_GenShadowFace`, and the fakecount dispatch
  branch in `Sh_GenerateFakeShadows`.
- `gl/gl_shader.c`: the `FAKESHADOWS_COUNT` define emission (plain `#define FAKESHADOWS` +
  `USE_ARB_SHADOW` remain); the `l_fakeshadowmatrix`/`l_fakeshadowcell` uniform-name rows.
- `gl/gl_backend.c`: `SP_FAKESHADOWMATRIX`/`SP_FAKESHADOWCELL` upload cases,
  `GLBE_SetFakeShadowCount/Slot`, the per-slot state fields.
- `gl/shader.h`: the two SP_ enum entries + setter decls.
- Gamedir: `nettest/glsl/defaultwall.glsl` override RETIRED entirely (post-strip it equalled the
  stock baked shader; moved to `glsl/retired/`); `defaultskin.glsl` self-shadow gate simplified
  to `defined(FAKESHADOWS) && !defined(TESS)`.  QC driver (`MapLights_DriveCasterShadows` +
  `MapLights_RegisterShadowCaster` + `cl_lightshadow_perlight`) deleted from the mod.

Added — `r_shadows_fakeres` (CVARD, default "2048", REALTIMELIGHTING): fake shadowmap texture
resolution.  Stock hardcoded `SHADOWMAP_SIZE*4` = 2048; now `smsize = bound(256, ival, 8192)` in
`Sh_GenerateFakeShadows`.  Higher = sharper at the same `r_shadows_fakedistance` coverage
(16-bit depth: 4096 ~ 32 MB).  This is the texel-COUNT dial; `r_shadows_fakedistance` remains
the texel-DENSITY/coverage dial.

Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 96 — de-"fake" the shadow cvar names + world-constant contact bias (`r_shadows_bias`)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

Renames (old names live on as silent CVARAFD aliases, so stuffed cfgs keep working):
- `r_shadows_fakedistance` → **`r_shadows_distance`** (coverage radius)
- `r_shadows_fakeres`      → **`r_shadows_res`** (depth map resolution, P95)

Contact-cutoff fix ("prop shadows cut off near the ground"): the ortho/FAKESHADOWS branch of
`sys/pcf.h::ShadowmapCoord` (gl_vidcommon.c) applied a 0.015 NDC z bias that SCALES with the
ortho radius — ~15 qu at distance 1024 — so any receiver within ~15 qu of its caster read as
lit and the shadow detached before contact.  Now:
- `gl_vidcommon.c`: the ortho/FAKESHADOWS bias term is REMOVED (spot/cube branches untouched).
- `gl_backend.c` (GLBE_SelectDLight ortho branch): `lightprojmatrix[14] -= r_shadows_bias.value
  / max(1, dl->radius)` — a WORLD-CONSTANT bias (default 2 qu) baked into the projection, the
  same architecture the removed P93 atlas validated (`pv[14] -= 2/radius`).
- New cvar `r_shadows_bias` (gl_shadow.c, default "2", world qu): lower = tighter contact,
  higher = kills acne on steep surfaces.
- Gamedir `defaultskin.glsl`: the vertex-side `z += (0.015-0.003)*w` cancellation line REMOVED
  (it existed only to counter pcf.h's old constant; keeping it would be a wrong-way bias =
  self-shadow acne).  Normal-offset (`r_shadows_selfshadow_nbias`) remains the acne guard.

Applies to all LSHADER_ORTHO consumption (incl. hypothetical ortho rtlights — none in use).
Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 97 — angled default sun direction + through-floor contact-shadow gap fade (`r_shadows_throwfade`)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

Two fixes for `r_shadows 2` on maps **without** an `env_sun`:

**(a) Angled default sun (was straight down).** The engine defaulted `r_shadows_throwdirection`
to `"0 0 -1"` and `r_sun_dir` to `"0.2 0.5 0.8"`. Straight-down light grazes vertical walls, so a
`func_detail` coplanar with a wall threw a shimmery shadow-acne band on it. New defaults
(`gl_shadow.c`) match the ericw-tools LIGHT default sun that bakes the lightmap (worldspawn
`_sun_mangle "230 -65 0"`), so dynamic shadows fall the same way as the baked static lighting:
- `r_sun_dir` → **`-0.271654 0.582563 0.766045`** (toward the sun)
- `r_shadows_throwdirection` → **`0.271654 -0.582563 -0.766045`** (the negated toward-sun)

The gamedir also stuffs these per map (`sv_env_sun.qc` clear-first, for old engines) and sets them
in `default.cfg`; maps with an `env_sun` still override as before.

**(b) Contact-shadow gap fade (stops shadows leaking through floors).** In the fake-shadow depth
pass the **world BSP is not a caster** (`smesh == NULL`; only entity meshes are drawn via
`GLBE_BaseEntTextures`). So a prop/player on an upper floor writes depth into the single global
ortho map and the floor *below* — a world surface that receives fake shadows — gets darkened, with
no intervening geometry to occlude the projection. Inherent to one global ortho map (no cascades,
no world occluder). Source hides the same limitation by baking static sun shadows into lightmaps
and using short-range/cascaded dynamic shadows.

Fix = a **two-tap compare** in `sys/pcf.h::ShadowmapFilter` (gl_vidcommon.c), needing NO depth read
(the sampler is compare-only `sampler2DShadow`): after the normal PCF result `s`, re-test the depth
compare at `shadowcoord.z - r_shadows_throwfade` (a hair closer to the light). If still lit, the
occluder is within `throwfade` of the receiver (a real contact shadow → keep `s`); if shadowed too,
the occluder is far in front (through-floor → `mix(1.0, s, 0)` = lit).
- New cvar `r_shadows_throwfade` (`gl_shadow.c`, default `"0.06"`): fraction of the ortho depth
  ([0,1] = 2·`r_shadows_distance` qu, so 0.06 ≈ 123 qu at distance 1024) beyond which a caster stops
  shadowing. Higher = longer reach (more leak); lower = tighter contact-only; `0` = off.
- Injected as a global `#define r_shadows_throwfade <value>` alongside `#define FAKESHADOWS`
  (`gl_shader.c`), so it reaches every fake-shadow compile; changes take effect on the next shader
  flush (`vid_reload` / `r_shadows` toggle). `pcf.h` keeps an `#ifndef` safety default.
- Model self-shadow and normal ground-contact shadows are unaffected (occluder is close → kept).
  Tradeoff: a very tall caster's long shadow tip can fade where the gap exceeds `throwfade`; raise
  the cvar for longer shadows.

Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 98 — model sun N·L "form shade" (`e_fakesundir` inject + `r_sun_dir` CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

Gives models directional *form* shading along the env_sun: faces pointing away from the sun get
darker, so props/cars/players read 3D and their light/dark split matches the direction their cast
shadow is thrown. (The `r_shadows 2` self-shadow only darkens where geometry *occludes* the sun —
concavities/contact; a convex car body has almost none, hence it read flat.) The model shader
already did N·L against `e_light_dir` (the light-grid dominant dir); this adds a term aligned to the
**env_sun** specifically. Extends the P97 inject site. Models only — world surfaces bake the sun's
N·L + shadows into their lightmaps (ericw LIGHT), so a runtime term there would double-count.

- `gl_shader.c`: in the `if (r_fakeshadows)` block (next to the P97 `r_shadows_throwfade` inject),
  also inject `#define e_fakesundir vec3(%f,%f,%f)` from `r_sun_dir.vec4` — the world toward-sun
  direction as a compile-time constant.
- `gl_shadow.c`: `r_sun_dir` promoted `CVARD`→`CVARFD(... CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM ...)`, so the per-map sun
  change (`env_sun` stuff) flushes shaders and re-injects `e_fakesundir` — no staleness across maps.
  Uses `r_sun_dir` (stable per map) rather than the swing-able `r_shadows_throwdirection` to avoid
  per-frame recompile churn; they're identical in all default cases (swing off; env_sun disables it).
- Gamedir `glsl/defaultskin.glsl` (loaded from disk, no engine dependency): under the existing
  `MODEL_SELFSHADOW` gate, vertex computes `vsunlambert = dot(normalize(mat3(m_model)*n),
  normalize(e_fakesundir))` (model-space deformed normal → world via `m_model`), fragment darkens
  `col.rgb *= mix(1.0, mix(r_shadows_sunshade_floor, 1.0, clamp(vsunlambert*0.5+0.5,0,1)),
  r_shadows_sunshade)`. New cvardf knobs `r_shadows_sunshade` (1) + `r_shadows_sunshade_floor` (0.5 =
  away-side ~50% bright); an `#ifndef e_fakesundir` safety default keeps it inert if not injected.
- Stacks multiplicatively with the light-grid shading and the self-shadow floor. Change needs a
  shader flush (`vid_reload`) like the other cvardf knobs.
- Future option (not done): a runtime `SP_E_SUNDIR` uniform (mirror `SP_LIGHTDIRECTION`, transform
  `r_sun_dir` world→model per draw) would let the form-shade follow the *swung* throw with no
  recompile — only worth it if `cl_lightshadow_swing` is used on env_sun-less maps.

Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 99 — `r_readimage` decodes DDS (CPU BCn → RGBA8) for QC pixel reads  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

`r_readimage` (CSQC/MenuQC builtin `PF_CL_readimage`, `pr_menu.c:932`) previously returned null for
DDS files, because `ReadRawImageFile` (`image.c:7687`) had no DDS branch — so the body-paint camo
(`cl_paint.qc`) could not read wall textures that ship only as DDS inside a pk3 (they fell back to a
flat olive tint). The engine already had everything needed: `Image_ReadDDSFile` (`image.c:6198`)
decodes DDS to a compressed BCn mip set, and `ReadRawImageFile`'s imageloader-plugin branch already
runs the CPU decompressor `Image_ChangeFormat` → RGBA8 when `force_rgba8` is set (which
`PF_CL_readimage` always passes). BC1–BC7 CPU decode is compiled in (`DECOMPRESS_S3TC/RGTC/BPTC` in
`config_fteqw.h`); it just wasn't routed for DDS.

Fix (`image.c`, under `#ifdef IMAGEFMT_DDS`, right after the BMP/ICO block): detect the `'DDS '`
magic, call the (same-file, static) `Image_ReadDDSFile`, then run the same mip-0 extraction the
plugin branch uses — `force_rgba8 → Image_ChangeFormat(rgbx8only)` then copy `mip[0]` out as RGBA8.
`Image_ReadDDSFile` sets `mips->extrafree = filedata` (the CALLER's buffer), so the branch nulls it
before cleanup and never frees the input. 2D textures only (cubemap/3D/array DDS still return null —
fine for a pixel-read builtin). Non-2D or BC6-HDR that can't reach RGBA8 → null → camo olive fallback.

Now `r_readimage` reads DDS/DXT1-5/BC7 the same as PNG/TGA/JPG/BMP, so camo can copy any loaded wall
texture regardless of container. Client image path only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 95 — Bilinear model/particle lightpoint sampling (r_modellight_bilinear)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

Models, particles and CSQC `getlight` sample the world lightmap through
`GLRecursiveLightPoint3C` (`gl/gl_rlight.c`), which took ONE nearest luxel (`int s,t` at the
top of the function truncate the luxel coordinate). Lit brush SURFACES are drawn with hardware
bilinear filtering, so with the new dense DECOUPLED_LM lightmaps (4qu/luxel) a model's single
nearest tap lands on an isolated black luxel — a sharp shadow edge or a `-dirt` AO corner —
where the bilinearly-filtered floor beside it stays lit. Result: models render black in spots
the surfaces don't. (The sampler already supported decoupled + E5BGR9 HDR correctly; the only
defect was nearest vs. bilinear.)

- Extracted the per-format single-luxel decode (LM_E5BGR9 / LM_RGB8 / LM_L8, all lightstyles +
  optional deluxe) into `LightPoint3C_AccumLuxel(mod, surf, lsi, lti, weight, l)` which adds a
  weighted luxel into `l[0..2]` (colour) and `l[3..5]` (deluxe direction).
- `GLRecursiveLightPoint3C` now does a 2×2 bilinear tap when `r_modellight_bilinear` is set:
  continuous luxel coords from the same `lmvecs` (minus the half-luxel bias, which is baked into
  decoupled `facelmvecs` but not classic `texinfo->vecs`), `floor`+frac for the 4 weights, each
  tap edge-clamped into `[0..(extents>>lmshift)]`. The nearest path is preserved verbatim via one
  `AccumLuxel(ds,dt,1.0)` call. The surface-selection bounds logic (`int s,t` + the
  `texturemins`/`extents` `continue` tests) is unchanged.
- New cvar `r_modellight_bilinear` (default **1**, CVAR_ARCHIVE, `client/renderer.c`). Set 0 for
  exact pre-patch nearest behaviour (safe in-game escape hatch). The non-3C `GLRecursiveLightPoint`
  (which only feeds the local-player `lightlev`) is deliberately untouched.

Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel/progs/protocol impact. Composes with Patch 94
(`r_modellight_fallback`, the black-sample retry ladder), which runs first at the sample-point
level; P95 refines the sample itself.

## Patch 96 — Model lightpoint: skip no-lightmap faces + HDR brightness parity  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

Two fixes in `GLRecursiveLightPoint3C` (`gl/gl_rlight.c`), the model/particle/CSQC world-light
sampler. These are the REAL fix for "models render black over a section on DECOUPLED_LM maps while
the lit surfaces look fine, classic `_lightmap_scale` is fine" (Patch 95's bilinear did not address
it — the data was never wrong; the surfaces and the sampler read the same `surf->samples`).

1. **Skip faces with no lightmap instead of returning terminal black.** ericw omits fully-dark
   faces from the DECOUPLED_LM lump (`light/write.cc:831 if(id.sorted.empty()) return;` before the
   offset write), so FTE sees `lmsize==0` → `out->samples=NULL` (gl_model.c:4552-4584). The old
   code did `if(!surf->samples){ l={0,0,0}; return l; }` — returning black AND terminating the
   descent. Because decoupled zeroes every face's `texturemins` (gl_model.c:4550), an omitted
   coplanar face can also win the CPU bbox accept-test over the lit floor a model rests on. Fixed:
   `if(!surf->samples) continue;` — keep descending / try the next face so the sampler finds the
   real lit surface. Classic (`_lightmap_scale`) never hit this because it wrote data for those
   faces. Surfaces were always immune (GPU interpolates atlas texcoords, no accept/reject).
2. **HDR (E5BGR9) brightness parity.** 3C decoded the exponent as `pow(2, exp-15-9+8)` = `2^(exp-16)`
   but the surface build uses `rgb9e5tab[exp]*(1<<7)` = `2^(exp-24)*2^7` = `2^(exp-17)`
   (client/image.c:223, r_surf.c:1511) — so model/viewmodel light was **2× brighter than the world**
   on HDR maps (pre-existing; inherited verbatim by the P95 helper). Changed the `+8` to `+7` in
   `LightPoint3C_AccumLuxel` so models match surfaces. NOTE: HDR model brightness halves — this is
   the correct value; content lit around the old 2×-bright models may read slightly darker.

Client render only — m-rel. Composes with P94 (black-sample retry ladder) and P95 (bilinear +
`r_modellight_bilinear`, kept). No sv-rel/progs/protocol impact.

## Patch 100 — `r_model_mincoverage`: screen-coverage cull for model entities  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `client/renderer.c` (cvar + registration), `gl/gl_alias.c` (`R_GAlias_GenerateBatches`).

**Problem.** Model entities were **frustum-culled only** (`gl_alias.c` `R_CullEntityBox`). There is no
distance or size cull anywhere for them, so a prop 3000qu away still paid a full batch generation,
`Alias_GAliasBuildMesh` skeletal rebuild, `R_CalcModelLighting` recursive lightmap sample, uniform
upload (bone matrices included) and draw call — in **every** pass — while covering almost no pixels.
On a prop-dense map this is the dominant main-pass cost.

Measured on the reporting user's all-props stress map (~60fps):
- `r_shadows 0` ≈ `r_shadows 2` ⇒ the fake-sun depth pass is NOT the cost. It only ever covered props
  inside the `r_shadows_distance` (1024) ortho box, i.e. a small slice; the main pass has no such limit.
- 640×480 ≈ native fps ⇒ **not** fragment/fill-bound.
⇒ the bottleneck is per-entity CPU/geometry work in the main pass, scaling with prop COUNT at any range.

**Fix.** The projected bounding-sphere coverage math already existed at `gl_alias.c:1843-1853` but was
dead code behind `if (clmodel->maxlod)` — always false for assets with no authored LOD (i.e. all of
them). Hoisted it out to run when `maxlod || r_model_mincoverage > 0`, and cull the entity when
`coverage < r_model_mincoverage`. Culling there (before the surface walk) drops the WHOLE per-entity
cost, not just triangles, and because both passes funnel through `BE_GenModelBatches` → this function,
one test culls render + shadow.

Coverage is a **fraction of the screen**, not a raw distance, so it is size-aware for free: a van
survives far out while a grass tuft drops early — something a flat distance cull cannot do.

**Exemptions (`sizecullable`).** Starts from the same set the frustum cull uses (`RF_WEAPONMODEL`,
`framestate.bonestate`) plus `RF_EXTERNALMODEL`, `RF_FIRSTPERSON` and `playerindex >= 0` — a distant
enemy blinking out is a gameplay bug, not an optimisation. (This game's players are CSQC skeletal
objects, so `bonestate` already covers them; the explicit tests keep plain packet-entity players safe.)

**Default 0 = OFF** — ships inert, opt-in per user tuning. Try 0.002–0.01. `CVAR_ARCHIVE`.
Composes with the stock LOD path (Patch-free): `maxlod` models still select surfaces by the same
coverage value, so if `lodrange` data is ever authored (FTE_MESH, `iqmtool lodrange`), both work off
one computation. Client render only — m-rel. No sv-rel/progs/protocol impact.

### Patch 100a — fix: `r_model_mincoverage` non-zero killed model self-shadowing  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Reported:** with `r_model_mincoverage 0.01` models stopped self-shadowing (and shadowing each other);
`0` restored it.

**Cause.** The coverage formula hoisted in Patch 100 is a **perspective** projected-sphere size. But
`Sh_GenShadowMap` **overwrites `r_refdef.m_projection_std` with the light's ORTHOGRAPHIC matrix**
(`gl_shadow.c` → `Matrix4x4_CM_Orthographic`) before generating the shadow faces. Under ortho the
perspective-divide term `(m[7]*r + m[11]*-z + m[15])` collapses to the constant `1`, so `coverage`
became a raw unprojected magnitude, fell under any sane threshold, and **every caster was culled out of
the depth map**. Note `vpn`/`vieworg` stay the CAMERA's through the shadow pass (the path sets
`r_refdef.m_view` directly and never calls `AngleVectors`) — *only* the projection is swapped, which is
what made the original code look correct.

**Fix.** Run the coverage block only under a perspective projection:
`if (r_refdef.m_projection_std[11] != 0 && (clmodel->maxlod || r_model_mincoverage.value > 0))`.
Verified constants: `Matrix4x4_CM_Projection_Far` sets `m[11] = -1, m[15] = 0`;
`Matrix4x4_CM_Orthographic` sets `m[11] = 0, m[15] = 1` (`common/mathlib.c`).
Testing the matrix directly keeps the guard adjacent to the assumption it protects and cannot go stale,
unlike plumbing `bemode` through `R_GAlias_GenerateBatches`'s 4 call sites (render.h, com_mesh.c:2437,
gl_alias.c:3034/3127, gl_heightmap.c:2906).

**No perf loss:** the fake-sun pass is already limited to the `r_shadows_distance` ortho box, so the far
props this cull targets were never drawn into it. Measured: `0 → 0.01` still 67 → 110 fps.

**Bonus:** this also protects the STOCK LOD path, which shares the flaw and would have selected nonsense
LOD levels in the shadow pass the moment any asset carried `lodrange` data.

---

## Patch 101 — `r_showhull`: frustum cull, non-blocking model peek, opaque lines  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `client/cl_ents.c` (`CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls`), `common/world.h` (+`Peek_CModel`),
`server/pr_cmds.c` (+`SVPR_PeekCModel`), `client/pr_csqc.c` (+`CSQC_World_PeekModelForIndex`).

User report: *"r_showhull 1 is slower at loading prop_physics ACD and they really chug my FPS."*
Both halves were real and had separate causes.

**1. The chug — no frustum cull.** `CLQ1_AddVisibleHulls` runs EVERY frame from
`CL_LinkPacketEntities` over EVERY edict and rebuilds all hull lines from scratch (the scenetris line
buffer is cleared per frame in `CL_ClearEntityLists`). Its only spatial filter was Patch 69's
`r_showhull_maxdist` — a **raw radius**, so hulls *behind the camera* were fully rebuilt: for a
decomposed prop that is pieces × tris × 3 `CLQ1_DrawLine` calls of CPU work (the van is 26 pieces)
handed straight to the rasteriser to discard. Added `R_CullSphere(origin, mod->radius*scale + 32)`.
`R_CullSphere` not `R_CullEntityBox`: no `entity_t` exists at that point, the sphere test is 4 dots,
and it has no inside-out failure mode. The **+32 slack** absorbs a one-frame frustum staleness — this
runs from `CL_EmitEntities`, which is called *before* `R_SetFrustum` for the frame, so
`r_refdef.frustum` is last frame's; without slack a fast turn pops hulls at the screen edge.

**2. The hitch — `Get_CModel` blocks the render thread.** `SVPR_GetCModel` / `CSQC_World_ModelForIndex`
call `COM_WorkerPartialSync` for a model whose `loadstate != MLS_LOADED`, i.e. they **stall the frame**
until the loader worker finishes — and a heavy concave prop's load runs its whole ACD decomposition
(up to 64 QuickHull builds via `Mod_ACDRecurse`). That is the multi-second first-sight hitch. A debug
wireframe must never do this. Added a **non-blocking `Peek_CModel`** to `world_t` (both SSQC and CSQC
implementations): returns the model only if already `MLS_LOADED`, else NULL — never loads, never syncs.
Not-ready props are simply skipped that frame and appear once the worker finishes, which is the
existing pop-in behaviour minus the stall. Peek never kicks the load; the prop's real
collision/render path already does. **Only for debug viz — never for collision, which must be correct.**

Also **hoisted the `r_showhull_maxdist` test ABOVE the model lookup** (it was below): no point asking
about — let alone blocking on — a prop we have already decided not to draw.

**3. Overdraw — opaque lines.** The `hullshader` was `sort additive` + `blendfunc add`, so every
crossing line in a dense self-overlapping wireframe paid a blend. Dropped both (and `alphagen vertex`
with them — `CLQ1_DrawLine` writes a=1 for every hull line, so with no blendfunc alpha is unused).
Lines now read **better**: additive was washing overlaps toward white and hiding the per-piece
decomposition hues. `rgbgen vertex` KEPT (per-piece colours + the green/yellow single-hull-vs-
fallback-box distinction ride on it); `polygonoffset` KEPT (stops z-fighting with the hugged surface).

**Not done (deliberate, staged):** the per-model cached line mesh (`hullviz_t` + edge dedup — the
current emit draws every shared hull edge twice) and model-space batch submission. Those remove the
per-frame CPU rebuild itself; the above only stops doing it for props you cannot see. Revisit if the
frustum cull is not enough. Client render only — m-rel. No progs/protocol impact.

---

## Patch 101a — CRITICAL: `Peek_CModel` placement broke the physics plugins  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Symptom:** "physics has stopped working, everything is sort of frozen when I load the map."

**Cause.** Patch 101 added `Peek_CModel` to `struct world_s` **next to `Get_CModel`, in the middle of
the struct**. `world_t` is shared ABI with the out-of-tree RBE **physics plugins**
(`fteplug_ode_x64.dll`, `fteplug_box3d_x64.dll`) — which are built separately, are **not** rebuilt by
`make m-rel`, and reach into `world_t` through offsets compiled into the DLL. Inserting a field shifted
every following member out from under them → the backend read garbage → physics silently died.

**Fix.** Moved the field to the **END** of the struct (offsets of all pre-existing members unchanged →
the shipped plugins keep working), with a comment marking `world_t` as plugin ABI. Anything added in
future goes at the bottom, or you rebuild the plugins (`make plugins-rel`) and ship them together.
See [[fte-plugin-abi-mismatch]]. **Lesson: `world_t` / any struct a plugin touches is append-only.**

---

## Patch 102 — skip collision hulls for non-prop models + FCAD **v2** prebuilt sidecars  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `common/com_mesh.c` (`Mod_SkipCollisionHulls`, `Mod_LoadACDSidecar` v2 branch,
`Mod_LoadIQMFile` gate); tools: `tools/acd_bake.py`, `tools/acd_bake_all.py`.

User report: *"hitches still occur when loading the ACD mesh"*, and *"we do have multiple threads but it
feels like it takes much longer than it should."* Both were right. `worker_count` defaults to 4, so
different models load in parallel — but one model's ACD is one serial task on one worker, and far too
much ACD work was being done at all.

**1. Non-prop skip (`sv_prop_hull_exclude`).** `Mod_LoadIQMFile` built a QuickHull of EVERY IQM's verts
(Patch 56) and, with `sv_prop_decomp >= 1`, ran the full decomposition — with **no test that the model
is ever a collidable prop**, because at load it cannot know. On this content that is **11 player models**
(highly concave, thousands of verts ⇒ the full recursive ACD, up to 64 QuickHull builds each) **+ 122
gibs**, all wasted, all on the worker the map load waits for. Only `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH/BOX` entities
ever reach `World_HullTrace`/`PM_HullTrace`; verified in the mod that those solids are set **only** in
the physprop/props/vehicle paths — never for players or gibs.
Added an **EXCLUDE** list (default `models/player/;models/gibs/`) rather than an include list: an
unlisted path keeps today's behaviour, so nothing silently loses collision by being forgotten. And an
excluded model that IS used as a prop degrades gracefully — `pmovetst.c:394` gates the hull trace on
`numhullplanes >= 4 || numhulls > 0`, so with no hull it falls back to the normal alias trace.

**2. FCAD v2 = prebuilt hulls.** v1 cached only the **partition**, so `Mod_LoadACDSidecar` still ran
`Mod_BuildConvHull` per piece on every load — a 26-piece van meant 26 QuickHull builds *from the file
that was supposed to be the cache*. v2 stores what those builds produce (planes/tris/bounds mirroring
`convhull_t`), so loading is a read + memcpy. v1 files still load unchanged (~584 ship).
Layout: `"FCAD" | i32 ver=2 | i32 npieces`, then per piece
`i32 numplanes | f32 planes[n*4] | i32 numtris | f32 tris[n*3*3] | f32 mins[3] | f32 maxs[3]`.
This also makes **convex (1-piece) props worth baking**, which v1 deliberately skipped (a 1-piece v1
file saved nothing; a 1-piece v2 file still skips that hull build) — `acd_bake_all.py`'s `convex-skip`
branch is removed accordingly.

**Writer correctness (the two traps).** CoACD pieces are already convex, so their own faces ARE the hull
surface — the tool must not re-run a hull algorithm or the collision geometry would drift from the asset.
Two things had to mirror the engine exactly:
- **Normal orientation** is decided by the piece CENTROID, not by mesh winding (decomposer winding is not
  something to bet collision on): for a convex piece the centroid is strictly inside, so
  `dot(n, centroid) - dist > 0` unambiguously means the normal is inward → flip.
- **`PLANE_CAP = 256`** mirrors the `cap` the engine passes to `Mod_BuildConvHull`. A tessellated piece
  (a barrel's curved shell) blows past it — an unclamped bake produced **632 planes/piece vs the runtime's
  ≤256**, which would have traded load time for FRAME time since `World_HullTrace` is O(numplanes). Over
  cap, the writer replicates Patch 57's merge exactly: fold the face into the most-parallel existing plane
  and keep the LOOSER `.w` (conservative-outward). Verified on a tessellated sphere: planes ≤ cap at 256
  and 64, and **zero verts outside the hull** either way — it never clips into the model.

**Baking is a long batch job** (CoACD ~1-2 min/model at `acd_bake.py` defaults; `acd_bake_all.py` uses
much faster tuned params). Existing v1 sidecars keep working meanwhile — v2 is a pure speedup, per asset.

## Patch 103 — collision hulls for `.mdl` (GoldSrc **and** Quake alias)  *(APPLIED — m-rel + sv-rel)*

**Files:** `common/com_mesh.h` (prototypes), `common/com_mesh.c` (de-static ×2, Q1 hull build),
`gl/gl_hlmdl.c` (GoldSrc hull build).

**Problem.** Only the IQM loader built a collision hull (Patch 56). **No `.mdl` ever did** — neither
GoldSrc (`mod_halflife`, gl_hlmdl.c) nor Quake alias (IDPO, `Mod_LoadQ1Model`). So every `.mdl` had
`numhullplanes == 0 && numhulls == 0`, and the trace gate
(`solid == SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH && (numhullplanes >= 4 || numhulls > 0)`, pmovetst.c:394 /
world.c:1257) silently fell through to a bbox. Consequences: all **75 dropped-weapon world models**
shared ONE hardcoded 12×5×3 box (`sv_weapons.qc:1879-1886`) — a knife and an AWP had identical
collision — and `sv_physprop_weapon_geom 1` (which already selects `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH`,
sv_weapons.qc:1865) appeared to do nothing. **No asset work was ever needed**: the verts were always
loaded, the loaders just never used them. No `.acd` either — a sidecar describes a multi-piece
DECOMPOSITION; this is the single convex hull (`mod->hullplanes`) that `sv_prop_collision 2` traces.

**GoldSrc — the trap.** The raw studio verts (`mesh->xyz_array`, copied verbatim at gl_hlmdl.c:262)
are **BONE-LOCAL**; the renderer transforms them per frame (`VectorTransform(... transform_matrix
[bonenums[v][0]] ...)`, :1562). A hull from raw verts is garbage. Measured on the real assets: all 35
GoldSrc `w_*.mdl` have exactly 1 bone and **0/35 have an identity bind pose** — `w_awp` bone0 =
`pos(3.0 0.3 0.7) rot(0.81 1.53 1.10)`, turning raw extent `(15.8 12.5 57.8)` into `(55.3 19.8 16.2)`
(barrel axis Z→X, centroid shifted 13.5qu). A raw-vert hull would be a rifle standing vertically,
offset from its own model.
**Fix:** extend the existing **Patch 60** block, which already computes exactly the needed bind-pose
transform (server-safe local matrix chain from the raw header) and was throwing the transformed verts
away after folding them into `mod->mins/maxs`. Keep them, build the hull, free. `mod->mins/maxs` is
already correct and in the same space at that point, so it passes straight through. Cap 256 = the IQM
caller's.

**Quake alias — the coverage finding.** Only **35 of the 75** `w_*.mdl` are GoldSrc; the other **40
are IDPO v6** (knife/ak47/awp/deagle/usp among them) and never enter gl_hlmdl.c. A GoldSrc-only fix
would have covered <half. Simpler case: Quake `.mdl` is vertex-animated, not skeletal, so
`poseofs[].ofsverts` is already model-space — no transform, no bone-local trap. Uses **pose 0** only
(the rest pose, matching the IQM loader's base verts): the bounds loop above it unions EVERY pose
because bounds must contain the whole animation, but a hull over every pose would be the animation's
swept volume — far too fat. Static props and `w_` models have one pose, so the two agree there.

**Plumbing.** `Mod_BuildConvHull` and `Mod_SkipCollisionHulls` were both `static` to com_mesh.c with
no prototypes anywhere; exposed via com_mesh.h (already included by gl_hlmdl.c) rather than
duplicated — a second implementation would drift, which is exactly how the reverted offline `.acd` v2
baker produced inflated hulls and lost Patch 63's bevels. Both loaders honour Patch 102's
`sv_prop_hull_exclude`. `gl_hlmdl.o` is in `COMMON_OBJS`, so it links into the dedicated server —
**sv-rel verified building**, not just m-rel.

**Non-issue, checked:** the `r_meshpitch` convention. HL models consume `ent->axis` built by
`AngleVectorsMesh` (cl_ents.c), which is format-agnostic, so a hull in model space rotates exactly as
the model draws — no pitch compensation needed, despite `mesh_noscale` existing for the RENDER path.

**STATUS: DISABLED — this crashed the game on LAUNCH (STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION 0xC0000374).**
Bisected to the GoldSrc half; the Q1 half is disabled with it (never proven innocent). The collection
side looks correct (Patch 60 bind transform; hullvertcount bounds-guarded; Mod_AddHullBevels enforces
HULL_MAXBEVELS), so the overrun is inside what Mod_BuildConvHull does with .mdl input —
Mod_BuildHullPlanes decimation is the next thing to read. Two lesser bugs found and FIXED on the way:
Mod_SkipCollisionHulls dereferenced cvar ->string, which is NULL until Cvar_Register runs (the CVAR
macros init it to NULL and hold the default elsewhere) — harmless while only the late-loading IQM path
called it, instant crash once the Quake loader did. Re-enable only with a heap-checked build
(gflags/ASAN) and a real repro. The design and research below stand.

**When re-enabled:** `sv_physprop_weapon_geom 1` (default 0) gives dropped weapons per-weapon
convex collision. `r_showhull 1` to inspect.

## Patch 104 — viewmodel opts out of the fake-sun shadowmap (`r_shadows_viewmodel`)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Symptom:** the first-person viewmodel looked like the player model was casting a shadow onto it. It was.

**Cause.** `r_shadow_playershadows 1` renders the local player's body into the `r_shadows 2` fake-sun depth
pass (it's hidden from the main view but still a caster — `gl_alias.c` skips it only when that cvar is 0).
The viewmodel is drawn *inside* that body and samples the same shadowmap, so the gun receives its owner's
shadow. The shader cannot simply special-case it: **`FAKESHADOWS` is a GLOBAL compile-time `#define`**
prepended to every model program (`gl_shader.c` `Shader_LoadPermutations`), and the gamedir
`glsl/defaultskin.glsl` turns it into `MODEL_SELFSHADOW` for *every* model. There is no per-entity gate.

**Fix — a per-entity uniform.** New `SP_E_NOSHADOWRECV` / GLSL `e_noshadowrecv` (float):

- `gl/shader.h` — `SP_E_NOSHADOWRECV` added to the *ent properties* enum group (renderer-internal; the
  physics/hl2/cod plugins never touch `shaderprogparmtype_e`, so this is not the append-only struct-ABI
  hazard of Patch 101a).
- `gl/gl_shader.c` — `{"e_noshadowrecv", SP_E_NOSHADOWRECV}` in `shader_unif_names`. That table is walked by
  `GLSlang_ProgAutoFields` (`gl_vidcommon.c`) which `glGetUniformLocation`s each name — so a plain
  `uniform float e_noshadowrecv;` in the gamedir GLSL binds it. **No `sys/defs.h` change needed.**
- `gl/gl_backend.c` — upload beside `SP_E_GLOWMOD`:
  `((shaderstate.curentity->flags & RF_WEAPONMODEL) && !r_shadows_viewmodel.ival) ? 1.0f : 0.0f`.
- `gl/gl_shadow.c` — `cvar_t r_shadows_viewmodel` (**"0"**, non-static so the backend externs it) +
  `Cvar_Register` beside `r_shadow_playershadows`. **Runtime** — unlike the `cvardf` shader knobs it needs no
  `vid_reload`.
- `d3d/d3d_backend.c` + `d3d/d3d8_backend.c` — added to the ignored-parm fallthrough group (silences
  `-Wswitch`; D3D simply keeps legacy behaviour).
- Gamedir `nettest/glsl/defaultskin.glsl` (not engine): declare the uniform under `MODEL_SELFSHADOW` and gate
  the self-shadow term — `ss = mix(1.0, ss, float(r_shadows_selfshadow) * (1.0 - clamp(e_noshadowrecv,0,1)));`

**FAIL-SAFE POLARITY (deliberate).** The flag is *suppress* (1 = don't receive), not *enable*. A GLSL uniform
reads **0** when unbound/unsupported, so any plumbing failure (D3D, an old gamedir GLSL, a link miss) degrades
to **normal shadow receive** — never to "self-shadows silently vanish on every model", which the enable
polarity would have caused.

**Scope:** only the self-shadow term. The sun form-shade (`r_shadows_sunshade`) still applies to the
viewmodel — it's orientation shading, not an occlusion artifact. `r_shadows_viewmodel 1` restores the old
look. Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 105 — `r_modellight_cache`: persist each model's world-lightmap sample  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Symptom:** a prop-dense map (651 props) ran at ~103fps / 9.7ms where the props' *drawing* was only ~1.8ms.

**Measured, not guessed.** `r_fullbright 1` early-outs of `R_CalcModelLighting` before the lightmap sample,
so it isolates that sample exactly: 103 → **293fps**. Void (props gone) = 630fps. ⇒ props = 8.1ms total, of
which **drawing = 1.8ms (~2.7µs/prop across 672 batches — healthy)** and **lighting = 6.3ms = 65% of the
entire frame**. This killed the planned static-prop batching/bake project outright: it would have attacked
the 1.8ms and left the 6.3ms. (Draw calls were never the problem — 731 draws is fine.)

**Cause.** `R_CalcModelLighting` (`gl_alias.c`) calls the world's `LightPointValues` → `GLRecursiveLightPoint3C`
(`gl_rlight.c`), a **recursive BSP walk** down to the floor that then bilinearly taps 4 luxels × up to 4
lightstyle maps, each with a `pow()`. There was **no cross-frame reuse whatsoever**: `cl_visedicts` is a
per-frame array and `CL_LinkPacketEntities` (`cl_ents.c`) clears `light_known` every frame, so 651 props that
never move re-derived identical numbers 60×/sec — ×4 more for ceiling props via Patch 94's retry ladder.

**Fix — a persistent per-entity cache of ONLY the lightmap sample.**
- `gl/gl_alias.c` — `modellightcache[4096]` (direct-mapped, `{seq, origin, shadelight, ambientlight, lightdir}`)
  + `R_SampleModelLight()` factored out so the fill path and the mode-2 self-check run identical code.
- `gl/gl_rlight.c` — `r_modellight_seq`, bumped from `R_AnimateLight` (which already walks every style once a
  frame, so the change-hash is ~free and **exact**) and from `Surf_NewMap` on map load.
- `client/client.h` — extern for `r_modellight_seq`. `client/renderer.c` — the cvar.

**Why it is EXACT, not an approximation.** The sample is a pure function of
`(sample point, lightstyle state, world lightdata, sampler cvars)`, and the sample point is itself a pure
function of `e->origin` (origin+24z, or the ladder's origin+0/−24/−48). So an entry is reusable **iff** origin
and `r_modellight_seq` both match. The seq hashes `d_lightstylevalue[]` + `cl_lightstyle[].colourkey` +
`r_modellight_bilinear` / `r_modellight_fallback` / `mod_lightpoint_distance` /
`r_shadow_realtime_world{,_lightmaps}` (all of which the sampler reads) + the worldmodel/lightdata pointers.
Hashing **values** rather than tracking `cvar->modified` means nothing can be silently missed, and a cvar
re-set to its existing value does not needlessly dump the cache. A map whose styles never change (a baked sun)
never bumps the seq and caches at 100%; a flickering light bumps it and every prop re-samples that frame.

**What is deliberately NOT cached.** Only the sampler is wrapped. The **dlight loop further down the same
function reads `cl_dlights` fresh every frame** and adds into `ambientlight`/`shadelight` *after* the cached
value lands — caching the function's final result instead would have **frozen muzzle flashes and explosions
onto every prop**. MLS handling, the lightmap-format clamps and the player/fbskin rules likewise still run per
frame. `RF_WEAPONMODEL` is not cached (it samples the eye, so it moves constantly).

**`e->keynum` is a HASH BUCKET, never a correctness input** — it is reused for tag-parents (`cl_ents.c`) so it
can collide. Validation is on **origin + seq**, so a collision degrades to a recompute, and two entities that
genuinely share an origin sharing an entry is *correct* (same point ⇒ same sample, by definition). Origin
validation also gives move-invalidation for free. **Stains do not invalidate:** they live in a separate
`stainmaps` buffer (`render.h`) and `LightPoint3C_AccumLuxel` only reads `surf->samples`.

**VERIFIED BY POSITIVE CONTROL, not by inspection.** `r_modellight_cache 2` uses the cached value but
re-samples anyway and prints a console error on any disagreement. On `notnormals` (651 props, 50s live):
**0 stale**. With a deliberate `cache->shadelight[0] += 1` injected: **4771 stale** — proving the check
actually executes and can fail, so the 0 is a real pass and not a no-op test. Also confirms the cache stores
the Patch 94 ladder's *result* (killing its repetition, not its outcome).

**Ship:** `r_modellight_cache` default **1**; `0` = engine default (re-sample every frame) for instant A/B;
`2` = validate. Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact. No struct-ABI risk (nothing
the physics/hl2/cod plugins read — cf. Patch 101a).

## Patch 106 — r_shadows 2 shadow-edge shimmer: whole-texel snap (was ¼-texel)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Symptom:** r_shadows 2 fake-sun shadows (incl. model self-shadow) shimmer/crawl along their edges when
the camera ROTATES, and worse at higher `r_shadows_distance`.

**Cause.** `Sh_OrthoAlignToFrustum` (`gl/gl_shadow.c`) DOES texel-snap the ortho shadow origin — the frustum
follows the camera (`neworg = r_origin + (radius/3)*vpn − focus`), so without snapping it slides sub-texel
each frame. But the snap grid was **`dl->radius/(smsize*2)`**, i.e. a QUARTER of a texel: the ortho projection
spans `-radius..+radius = 2*radius` world units over `smsize` texels (`gl_backend.c` LSHADER_ORTHO block:
`xmin=-radius, xmax=+radius`; `ShadowmapCoord = (ndc+1)*0.5`), so one texel is **`2*radius/smsize`** and the
grid was `texel/4`. Snapping to a quarter-texel lattice leaves a world point's fractional texel position free
to land on {0,¼,½,¾}, so the depth-compare boundary steps as the frustum swings → edges crawl. Scales with
`r_shadows_distance` twice: coarser texels AND a bigger `radius/3` centre swing.

**Fix (one line, `gl_shadow.c` `Sh_OrthoAlignToFrustum`):** `scale = dl->radius/(smsize*2)` →
`scale = 2.0*dl->radius/smsize` (whole texel). Every world point now hashes to the same texel every frame
regardless of the camera-follow swing → the crawl is gone, zero quality loss. The depth-axis (`axis[0]`) snap
in the same loop is a provable no-op (a translation along the light dir cancels in the light-space depth
compare), so all three axes can stay snapped; the transverse axes are the ones that matter. Also removed the
stale `//there's 1 sample every dl->radius/(smsize*2)` comment (the off-by-4). The shared function's other
caller (static ORTHO rtlight, `gl_shadow.c` ~4374, passes `SHADOWMAP_SIZE`) uses the identical `2*radius`
ortho, so the fix is correct there too (and that path is currently unused).

**Residual levers (NOT changed):** `r_shadows_res` (mod 4096) ↑ / `r_shadows_distance` (mod 2048) ↓ shrink
world-per-texel for crisper edges; `r_glsl_pcf` is a 3×3 hardware PCF capped at 9 (can't widen via cvar — the
built-in `sys/pcf.h` from `glsl_hdrs[]` wins over any gamedir copy). Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel,
progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 107 — per-entity "don't RECEIVE the fake-sun shadow" (prop_static "Don't Self-Shadow" flag)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Goal:** let a specific model opt OUT of self-shadowing (being darkened by the r_shadows 2 sun map) while
still CASTING its shadow normally. Used by a new prop_static/prop_detail spawnflag 64 "Don't Self-Shadow".

**Why it's a per-entity RECEIVE toggle, not a cast toggle.** r_shadows 2 is a SINGLE shared ortho depth map;
a model is either in it (casts on world + others + self) or not (`RF_NOSHADOW` / flag 16 = casts on nothing —
and can't self-shadow, its geometry isn't in the map). The map has no caster identity, so "cast on the world
but not on itself" is impossible. But the RECEIVE side (whether a model SAMPLES the map — the
`MODEL_SELFSHADOW` term in the gamedir `defaultskin.glsl`) IS per-entity, via the P104 `e_noshadowrecv`
uniform. This patch adds a second driver for that uniform.

**Reuses P104.** `e_noshadowrecv` (uploaded in `gl_backend.c` `SP_E_NOSHADOWRECV`) already suppresses the
self-shadow term for the viewmodel. Extended to also fire on a new render flag `RF_NOSHADOWRECV`.

- `common/protocol.h` — `#define RF_NOSHADOWRECV (1u<<23)` (internal render flag; the retired
  Q2EXRF_BLOB_SHADOW slot, unused. NOT networked as an entity flag — set fresh by the CSQC→render copy).
- `common/pr_common.h` — `#define CSQCRF_NOSELFSHADOW 2048` (was the `//CSQCRF_UNUSED 2048` placeholder). This
  is the QC-facing `.renderflags` bit.
- `client/pr_csqc.c` (~797, the CSQCRF→RF mapping block) — `if (rflags & CSQCRF_NOSELFSHADOW) out->flags |=
  RF_NOSHADOWRECV;`. **CSQC `.renderflags` is FILTERED, not passed through** — only known `CSQCRF_*` bits map
  to `RF_*`, so a raw high bit would be ignored; this mapping line is mandatory.
- `gl/gl_backend.c` `SP_E_NOSHADOWRECV` — now `supp = (flags & RF_NOSHADOWRECV) ? 1 : 0; if (RF_WEAPONMODEL &&
  !r_shadows_viewmodel) supp = 1;`. Fail-safe polarity preserved (unbound uniform reads 0 = normal receive).

**Mod side (QC + FGD).** `cl_defs.qc` `RF_NOSELFSHADOW = 2048`. `sv_props.qc` `PROP_NOSELFSHADOW = 64`;
`predprop_Send`'s shadow byte became a FLAGS byte (bit1 NOSHADOW / bit2 NOSELFSHADOW — same wire size),
`CSQC_PredProp_Update` reads it and sets `self.renderflags` RF_NOSHADOW / RF_NOSELFSHADOW. FGD flag 64 on
prop_static + prop_detail.

**LIMITATION — needs Predicted collision (flag 8).** Only the CSQC-mirror wire (`predprop_Send`) carries the
bit. A standard-net prop can't: the entity delta networks only 16 bits of effects (U_EFFECTS + U_EFFECTS16,
`sv_ents.c`) and there is no free EF bit below 1<<16 (1<<19 EF_UNUSED19 is the first free one, out of range).
So flag 64 no-ops without flag 8 — labelled so in the FGD. (Hero props you'd tune shadows on are predicted
anyway.) Client render + CSQC only — m-rel; the QC half needs a progs rebuild + reconnect.

## Patch 108 — per-entity dominant-light sun-shade (`e_sundir`)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Goal:** Source-style dominant-light model shading — a prop beside a lamp shades toward THAT lamp; one out in
the open shades toward the sun. Previously the sun form-shade (`r_shadows_sunshade`) used ONE global direction
(`e_fakesundir`, a compile-time `#define` from `r_sun_dir`) for every model on the map.

**Also a correctness fix.** Models were already *lit* per-entity (the shader's lambert uses `e_light_dir`, a
per-entity deluxemap sample) but *shaded* by the global sun — the two could point different ways, so a prop was
lit from one side and shaded from another. Now they agree.

**New per-entity uniform `e_sundir`** (world space, pointing TOWARD the light) — same 4 touch points as the
`e_noshadowrecv` precedent (P104/P107):
- `gl/shader.h` — `SP_E_SUNDIR` in the ent-properties enum.
- `gl/gl_shader.c` — `{"e_sundir", SP_E_SUNDIR}` in `shader_unif_names` (walked by `GLSlang_ProgAutoFields`, so
  a plain `uniform vec3 e_sundir;` in the gamedir GLSL binds it — no `sys/defs.h` change).
- `gl/gl_backend.c` — the upload case (next to `SP_E_NOSHADOWRECV`).
- `d3d/d3d_backend.c` + `d3d/d3d8_backend.c` — added to the ignored-parm fallthrough (silences `-Wswitch`).

**RECONSTRUCTED, not stored — deliberately no new `entity_t` field.** `gl_alias.c` writes `e->light_dir` as the
world direction PROJECTED onto the entity's orthonormal axes (`light_dir[i] = DotProduct(worlddir, e->axis[i])`),
so the backend inverts it: `world = axis[0]*ld[0] + axis[1]*ld[1] + axis[2]*ld[2]`, normalized. Adding a field
to `entity_t` would be a **plugin struct-ABI hazard** (the prebuilt hl2/cod plugins reach it via
`NewSceneEntity`) — see the append-only rule at the top of this file.

**Fallback to the global `r_sun_dir` when there is no per-entity information:**
- `cl.worldmodel->deluxdata == NULL` (map compiled without `.lux`/`LIGHTINGDIR`) — `LightPointValues` would
  otherwise return a CONSTANT `normalize(1,0,1)`, which looks worse than the sun. So un-relit maps are
  **byte-identical to before** (zero regression).
- `RF_WEAPONMODEL` — that branch (`gl_alias.c` ~:1826) transforms through the VIEW basis first, so the plain
  inverse doesn't apply.
- Degenerate sample (`VectorNormalize` returns 0).

**Freshness is free.** `R_CalcModelLighting`'s sample is cached per entity and the Patch-105 cache **validates
on origin** (exact `VectorEquals`) — a `prop_static` hits the cache forever, a rolling `prop_physics` misses and
re-samples every frame. No think-hook, no networking, no QC.

**Gamedir side** (`nettest/glsl/defaultskin.glsl`, `vid_reload`): declares `uniform vec3 e_sundir`, and the
form-shade direction becomes `mix(global_sun, e_sundir, r_shadows_sunshade_perprop)` with **two NaN guards** (an
unbound uniform reads `(0,0,0)`; and a partial blend of two near-opposite directions can cancel to zero — both
fall back to the sun). New knob `r_shadows_sunshade_perprop` (cvardf, default 1; **0 = exactly the old
global-sun look**, for instant A/B). Polarity matches: `e_light_dir` is *toward* the light (the lambert at ~:135
uses `+e_light_dir`), same convention as `r_sun_dir`. Do NOT copy the PBR branch (~:453), which uses
`-e_light_dir`.

**PREREQUISITE — the map needs a deluxemap.** Compile with `light -bspxlux`. Present today on: `2fort`,
`fy_killzone`, `normals`, `notnormals`, `parkour`, `surf_testramps`. **NOT** on `notnormals_shadowtest` or the
CS/Source imports — those keep the global sun until relit.

**Scope:** shading only. Per-prop CAST (ground) shadow direction remains impossible — `Sh_GenerateFakeShadows`
builds one light, one ortho frustum, one depth map and one `l_cubematrix`; one map = one direction by
construction. Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact.

## Patch 109 — deluxemap light direction decoded in the WRONG SPACE + inverted (`r_modellight_worlddir`)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Symptom that exposed it:** with P108's per-prop sun-shade live (and `r_shadows_sunshade_ceil 4` amplifying
4x), "the top of all the props is dark, and the sides are well lit" on deluxemapped maps.

**Root cause — a ~2010 upstream bug, NOT a P108 regression.** Both bakers store the deluxel as
`(dot(L,svector), dot(L,tvector), dot(L,facenormal))` with **L pointing TOWARD the light**, in the face's
**TANGENT** basis — FTE's own `gl/ltface.c` (~:980, basis ~:911) and ericw-tools `light/write.cc` (~:452,
basis `ltface.cc:690`). `GLQ1BSP_LightPointValues` (`gl/gl_rlight.c` ~:3483) consumed those tangent
coefficients as if they were **world x/y/z**, and additionally **negated the third**:
```c
res_dir[0] = r[3];  res_dir[1] = r[4];  res_dir[2] = -r[5];
```
The model light sample traces straight DOWN (`gl_alias.c` ~:1418 samples origin+24), so the hit face is
almost always a **floor** => `facenormal = +Z`. An overhead light bakes to `(0,0,+1)` => decodes to
**`(0,0,-1)` = straight DOWN**. So on every deluxemapped map, model lighting has always been **lit from
below**, with a **scrambled azimuth** on rotated/sloped faces (s/t are texture axes, not world X/Y). It was
invisible in the additive lambert and only became glaring once the sun-shade amplified it.

**Fix:** rotate the deluxel into world space with the real face basis at the sample site — the only place
`surf` is in scope (`GLRecursiveLightPoint3C`, before `return l;`): `world = s*l[3] + (-t)*l[4] + n*l[5]`
(**+l[5]**, no negation), using `surf->texinfo->vecs` (ericw derives s/t from texinfo even on DECOUPLED_LM
faces) and `surf->plane->normal` with `SURF_PLANEBACK` handled. Rejected if it ends up facing behind the
sampled face. Carried to the consumer in file-scope `lightpoint_worlddir`/`_ok` — both are inside ONE
synchronous `LightPointValues` call, so **no per-entity storage is needed**, which matters because
`entity_t` is plugin-visible (`plugins/plugin.h`, hl2/cod build `entity_t` arrays with their own compiled
`sizeof`) so appending a field would be the Patch-101a stride/ABI hazard. Cleared at function entry so a
miss can't leak a stale direction. Gated by **`r_modellight_worlddir`** (default 1; 0 = legacy decode).

**REQUIRED companion shader change** (`nettest/glsl/defaultskin.glsl`): `e_light_dir` is consumed with TWO
OPPOSITE conventions — the lambert (~:142/:145) treats it as toward-light (was therefore the broken half),
while the PBR branch passed `-e_light_dir` (~:477) and gloss used `- e_light_dir` (~:479), which were
**accidentally correct** because the decode was inverted. `DoPBR`'s 3rd arg is toward-light (its body does
`dot(n,l)` clamped positive; `defaultwall.glsl`/`rtlight.glsl` both pass theirs unnegated). With the decode
fixed, those two negations MUST be dropped or specular lights from underneath. Both flipped in the same
change. `r_modellight_worlddir 0` restores both legacy halves together.

**Blast radius:** model lighting on deluxemapped maps only (`2fort`, `fy_killzone`, `normals`, `notnormals`,
`parkour`, `surf_testramps`); maps without a `.lux` never reach this code. The change is a *correction* —
models stop being lit from below — but it is a visible change, hence the revert cvar. Client render only.

## Patch 110 — per-prop cast shadow directions: the N-slot fake-shadow atlas (`r_shadows_slots`)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

`r_shadows 2` renders every caster into ONE ortho depth map (`gl_shadow.c` `static dlight_t r_fakelight`,
one `l_cubematrix`, `shadowmap[2]`). An orthographic projection **is** a single parallel direction, so the
whole world's shadows fall the same way. After Patch 108/109 made model *shading* per-prop, a barrel beside
a lamp was **shaded** by the lamp but **shadowed** along the sun. This closes that gap: the depth map is
split into N cells, each rendered from a different dominant-light direction, with every caster assigned to
exactly ONE cell.

**This is Patch 93 revived, and the reason it died is now fixed.** P93 built the same atlas; P95 deleted it
because slot assignment came from a QC registry fed by `BlobShadow_Emit` — `prop_static` has no CSQC predraw
and settled physics props unhook theirs, so static props never registered and were rendered into whatever
*moving* caster's box covered them, inheriting the player's angle (see the P93 REDESIGN 3 addendum). Patch
108's per-entity deluxemap direction removes the registry entirely. The P93 C code is **not in git** (add and
remove never hit a committed tree) and was rewritten; the shader half survived in `glsl/retired/`.

- `gl/gl_alias.c` — new **`R_EntityDominantLightDir`** (decl `client/render.h`): reconstructs an entity's
  world-space dominant light dir from `light_dir` × `axis[]`. `SP_E_SUNDIR` now calls it too, so a prop's
  SHADE direction and its CAST direction cannot drift apart. Takes a `const entity_t*` and casts internally
  — the `R_CalcModelLighting` call it makes is pure memoisation (the renderer performs that same fill
  moments later in `R_GAlias_DrawBatch`). **That call is load-bearing:** `light_dir` is filled at DRAW time
  and `CL_LinkPacketEntities` clears `light_known` every frame, so the bucketer (which runs at the top of
  `GLBE_DrawWorld`) would otherwise read LAST frame's value left in that `cl_visedicts` slot.
  Also the per-slot caster filter in `BE_GenModelBatches`, placed after the `dl->key` test and **before**
  `EdictInFatPVS` so rejects skip the PVS walk.
- `gl/gl_shadow.c` — cvars `r_shadows_slots` (1..8, default **1**, CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM), `_hyst` (1.5),
  `_pcf` (4), `_debug`. `Sh_DirBucketId`/`Sh_BucketIdToDir` over a fixed 16×4 equal-area lattice (64 ids,
  ~13° half-angle) — a bucket's representative is the lattice cell **centre, never the mean of its members**
  (a mean drifts as members join/leave and props chase it). `Sh_FakeShadowChooseSlots` histograms visible
  casters, drops anything within 20° of the sun (slot 0 serves those), and assigns slots with hysteresis +
  a 30-frame idle timer. `Sh_FakeShadowFilter` + `Sh_GenerateFakeShadowsAtlas`, and the `sh_fakecell_*`
  viewport override in `Sh_GenShadowFace`.
- `gl/gl_backend.c` — `fakeshadowmatrix[8][16]`/`fakeshadowcell[8]`/`fakeshadowcount`,
  `SP_FAKESHADOWMATRIX`/`SP_FAKESHADOWCELL` uploads (model-composed like `SP_LIGHTCUBEMATRIX`),
  `GLBE_SetFakeShadowCount`/`CaptureFakeShadowSlot`/`ClearFakeShadowSlot`.
- `gl/gl_shader.c` — `FAKESHADOWS_COUNT` define emission; **four** uniform-name rows (both the bare and the
  `[0]` spelling of each array — the binder does a literal `glGetUniformLocation` with no name normalisation
  and drivers disagree about which form of an array's element 0 resolves; registering both guarantees a hit,
  and a driver that resolves both merely uploads twice with identical data).
- `gl/shader.h`, `d3d/d3d_backend.c`, `d3d/d3d8_backend.c` — enum + `-Wswitch` fallthroughs.
- Gamedir GLSL — `nettest/glsl/defaultwall.glsl` **restored as an override** (a fresh copy of today's baked
  shader plus the three multi blocks, so upstream changes since P93 are picked up) and `defaultskin.glsl`.
  ONE sampler with N cells, never N samplers: `defaultwall`'s worst case is already 15 of 16 TMUs.

**Traps preserved from P93** (all four cost real debugging time the first time):
1. `GLBE_SelectDLight` MUST run per slot before `Sh_GenShadowFace` — it sets `shaderstate.curdlight`, which
   the BEM_DEPTHONLY batcher dereferences (`ent->keynum == dl->key`). NULL deref otherwise.
2. `GL_ViewportUpdate` flips `pxrect.y` to GL bottom-origin. The legacy path centres its region so the flip
   is invisible; **asymmetric atlas cells are not** — the cell uniform's v-offset must be the cell's BOTTOM
   edge, or every cell samples the empty half and there are NO shadows at any count > 1.
3. Exactly ONE `GLBE_BeginShadowMap` — it clears the WHOLE texture, so per-slot Begins wipe earlier cells.
   (This is why the atlas cannot be built on `Sh_GenShadowMap`, which does its own Begin/End.)
4. Every slot stays ORTHO. Perspective/spot never lined up with the ortho-tuned consumption shader.
   Slot matrices are **snapshotted** out of `GLBE_SelectDLight` rather than rebuilt, so they cannot disagree.

**Two things the retired shader got wrong and this one fixes:** it predated Patch 97, reimplementing PCF
inline without the `r_shadows_throwfade` contact-gap fade (restoring it verbatim would have silently
regressed through-floor leaking at N>1) — added per cell; and the multi path is gated `!TESS`, because it
needs an ARRAY varying and FTE's tessellation varying-collection was never verified to handle those.

**Models need no per-slot uniform.** A model renders into exactly one cell, so it self-shadows there (now
from the light that actually lights it, not always the sun) and is merely absent from foreign cells, where
it still correctly RECEIVES others' shadows. Strictly more correct than the single map, not a compromise.

**Cost.** CPU is fine — triangle work is constant (each caster renders once); +0.1–0.3 ms at N=4. GPU is the
real price: all N boxes are view-centred with the same radius, so a visible pixel is inside essentially all
of them and the `fd < 1.0` early-out buys nothing. N=4 at uniform 9-tap = 40 shadow taps per world pixel vs
10 (4×); `r_shadows_slots_pcf 4` drops that to 25 (2.5×). `r_shadows_res` is the WHOLE texture and the grid
subdivides it, so N≤4 → 2×2 → 992² per cell from 2048² — sharpness halves. **Not auto-scaled** (a silent
jump to 4096 is 32–64 MB); the tested "on" setting is `r_shadows_slots 4` + `r_shadows_res 4096` ≈ today's
density. N=3 is pointless (the grid is 2×2 either way).

**Default `r_shadows_slots 1` = byte-identical to before this patch** — the legacy single path is untouched
and the shaders keep a verbatim `#if FAKESHADOWS_COUNT < 2` branch, so it is the same compiled code, not
merely the same value. Needs a deluxemap: without one every entity falls back to the sun, every bucket
collapses into slot 0, and the bucketer returns 1 (legacy path) — correct and free, but the feature does
nothing. Only `2fort`, `fy_killzone`, `normals`, `notnormals`, `parkour`, `surf_testramps` have `.lux`.
An outdoor map correctly collapses to 1 slot too: every prop genuinely points at the sun.

Client render only — m-rel; no sv-rel, progs, or protocol impact. GL-only (the atlas branch is
`qrenderer == QR_OPENGL`; other backends take the legacy single path).

### Patch 110a — fitted cells + eased directions (the "snappy / lower res" follow-up)

First cut shipped with two flaws the user caught immediately: shadows **snapped** between directions
instead of gliding like the sunshade, and the map looked **lower-res**. Both were design errors, not bugs.

**Snapping — the lattice was doing two jobs.** The 16×4 direction lattice was used both to ASSIGN props to
cells *and* as the direction actually rendered (`Sh_BucketIdToDir` = the cell centre). That makes the cast
direction one of only 64 fixed vectors, so a prop crossing a lattice boundary jumped ~26° in a frame, while
`e_sundir` (which shades it) moved continuously. Split the two jobs: the lattice still decides membership —
that is what keeps a static prop's assignment bit-constant, the property whose absence killed P93 — but the
**rendered direction is now the running mean of the cell's actual members**, eased with a frame-rate
independent exponential (`r_shadows_slots_smooth`, default 0.25s). Continuous direction, stable membership.

**Resolution — every cell was covering the whole world.** All slots used the shared view-sized box
(`r_shadows_distance`), so a cell holding 3 props spent its texels on the same 4096-unit volume as the cell
holding 52. Now each non-sun cell's ortho box is **fitted to the bounds of its own members** plus
`r_shadows_slots_margin` (the room the shadow needs to reach the floor), via a new `Sh_OrthoAlignToPoint`
(view-INDEPENDENT, same whole-texel snap — a view-centred fitted box would swing the whole cell's shadows as
the player walks, which is precisely how P93's per-light boxes failed). Measured on `parkour`: fitted cells
land at **r354 against the sun's r2048**. Per-slot extents mean the ortho projection moves inside the loop.

Two further consequences, both good: the shader's `fd < 1.0` box test now genuinely early-outs for pixels
outside a small cell (the first cut had every cell covering the screen, so it never rejected anything), and
the atlas layout became **uneven** — `Sh_FakeShadowCellRect` gives slot 0 a **3/4 × 3/4** cell (9× the area
of the rest) with seven quarter-size cells tiling the remaining L. At `r_shadows_res 4096`: sun cell ≈ 0.74
texels/world-unit vs 1.0 for a single full-texture map (so still ~26% softer — the honest residual), fitted
cells ≈ 1.4 (**sharper than the original single map**). `MAX_FAKESHADOW_SLOTS` is 8 = what that layout holds.

Also `r_shadows_slots_hyst` 1.5 → **2.5**: a cell changing owner moves every prop in it at once, so
ownership should be stickier than the first cut assumed. New cvars in `data/default.cfg`.

**Remaining hard limit, by construction:** with N cells a prop's cast direction can take only N values at
any instant, so it can never be as continuous as per-pixel shading. Easing hides direction *changes*; it
cannot make a prop's shadow interpolate between two cells. More slots = finer quantisation.

## Patch 111 — QC field writes woke the whole Box3D contact island  *(APPLIED — plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d)*

**File:** `engine/common/com_phys_box3d.c` (the **box3d plugin**, not the exe — build with
`make plugins-rel FTE_TARGET=win64 NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d`, per the note at `plugins/Makefile:271-280`.
`make m-rel` does **not** compile this file; the exe relinks but the change is not in it.)

**Symptom.** Two `prop_physics` floating on top of each other in water rose to the waterline, dropped back,
and repeated on a ~0.7–1 s cycle indefinitely. Props resting in shallow water were spuriously woken and
flung upward. Neither pile could ever go to sleep.

**Cause.** `World_Box3D_Frame_BodyFromEntity` marks a body `modified` when **any** of origin / velocity /
angles / avelocity / gravity differs from the last read-back (`:784-789`), and the push block then ended
with an **unconditional** `b3Body_SetAwake(body, true)`. But `b3Body_SetAwake` wakes the **entire contact
island** (`box3d-main/src/body.c:1965` → `b3WakeSolverSet`), resetting `sleepTime = 0` on every body
touching this one. So a QC routine that merely zeroed a settled prop's velocity or switched its gravity
off — i.e. precisely what a *"this has come to rest"* path does — woke every prop stacked on or under it.
QC could never put a pile to rest: each prop settling re-woke its neighbours.

**Fix.** Defer to Box3D's own setters, which already get this right — all three verified in
`box3d-main/src/body.c`:

| setter | wakes? | applies while asleep? |
|---|---|---|
| `SetLinearVelocity` / `SetAngularVelocity` | only for a **non-zero** value (`:1149`) | no — but the only write it drops is a *zero* write to an already-still body, a no-op |
| `SetTransform` (`:1063`) | never | **yes** — goes through `b3GetBodySim`, not `b3GetBodyState` |
| `SetGravityScale` (`:1931`) | never | **yes** — same |

So the only case that must still force a wake is a **teleport**: QC moving or rotating a sleeping body has
to re-evaluate its contacts, and `SetTransform` will not do that on its own. Added a `xformchanged` flag
(set only by an origin/angles difference) and gated the `SetAwake` on it.

**Why this is safe.** An earlier read of this claimed `SetTransform` is "silently discarded on a sleeping
body", which would have meant `ed->rbe.*` diverging from the body whenever we skipped the wake. That is
**wrong** — `SetTransform` and `SetGravityScale` both use `b3GetBodySim` and apply regardless of solver set,
so the existing unconditional `ed->rbe.*` copy stays correct. Verified in the library source before patching.

Kinematic player-push (`SOLID_SLIDEBOX`, `:831`), `RBECMD_ENABLE` and the ragdoll path keep their
unconditional wakes — a player body must stay awake to shove props, and re-enabling a disabled body cannot
work without it (`b3Body_SetAwake` is a no-op on `b3_disabledSet`, which is `< b3_firstSleepingSet`).

Paired with the QC-side "silence rule" in `sv_physprop.qc`: while a prop is resting, QC writes **nothing**
to it. The two together are what let a stacked pile of floating props actually settle.

## Patch 114 — sun cascades: split `r_shadows 2` into view-depth cascades (`r_shadows_cascades`)  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shadow.c` (generation + cvars + first-frame NaN fix), `engine/gl/gl_shader.c`
(`FAKESHADOWS_COUNT` / new `FAKESHADOWS_CASCADE` injection). Shader consumption is in the **loose gamedir**
`nettest/glsl/defaultwall.glsl` + `defaultskin.glsl` (the MULTI path inlines its own sampling; `sys/pcf.h`
is **not** involved and needs no rebuild). Client only — no shared struct touched, so no plugin/sv rebuild.

**Problem.** The single `r_shadows 2` sun map spends its whole resolution on one view-sized ortho box, so a
player 30 qu away and the skyline 1500 qu away share the same texel density (2.0 texels/qu at 4096²/1024,
fading out ~1900 qu). That is "low-res up close AND short range" — the trade a single map can't escape.

**Fix.** Split the SUN into N nested cascades fitted to successive view-depth slices. This **reuses P110's
atlas plumbing wholesale** — the per-cell projection matrix (`fakeshadowmatrix[]`), cell rect
(`fakeshadowcell[]`), and the shader's per-cell sample loop. Only the cell *contents* differ:

- `Sh_GenerateCascadeAtlas` renders every cascade from the **same** sun direction, each fitted to a PSSM
  frustum slice (`Sh_CascadeSplit`, λ = `r_shadows_cascade_lambda` 0.85 blends log/uniform splits) via a
  world-space bounding sphere + the Patch-106 whole-texel snap (`Sh_OrthoAlignToPoint`). 2×2 equal cells
  (`Sh_CascadeCellRect`), up to 4 cascades; near cascade's sharpness comes from its box **shrinking**, not
  a bigger cell.
- Every caster renders into **every** cascade (`fs_curslot` stays −1 → `Sh_FakeShadowFilter` passes all),
  unlike a direction slot a caster belongs to exactly one of.
- Shader (`FAKESHADOWS_CASCADE`): cascades are nested boxes of one sun, so a near pixel sits inside several.
  The loop picks the **tightest** cascade that contains the pixel (densest data) and takes exactly one —
  *not* the additive union the P110 direction path uses, which would triple-darken a near pixel's own
  shadow. Inner cascades hand off at `fd 0.9` to the next (their outer 10 % overlaps it) so there is no lit
  ring between cascades; only the outermost fades to lit at the true coverage edge.

**Mutually exclusive with `r_shadows_slots`.** Slots re-key the cells by *direction*, cascades by *depth*;
they can't both own the atlas. Slots win when > 1 (the opt-in lamp-shadow feature); cascades apply only at
`slots == 1`. `cascades == 1` is the legacy single map, **bit-identical** (no `FAKESHADOWS_CASCADE`, count 1).

**Also here (B4 part 1):** the shadow darkening floor is now `r_shadows_floor` (cvardf, cascade path;
default 0.5 = the old hard `s*0.5+0.5`). SUNVIS (Patch 113-adjacent) now stops the double-darkening that
floor guarded against, so it can be dialled down for punchier shadows. Models keep their existing
`r_shadows_selfshadow_floor`.

**First-frame NaN fix (folded in).** `Sh_GenerateFakeShadows` called `Sh_OrthoAlignToFrustum` (which divides
by `scale = 2*radius/smsize`) **before** assigning `l->radius`. On frame 1 `r_fakelight` is static-zeroed →
`radius 0` → `scale 0` → div-by-zero NaN origin that then defeated the cull. Radius is now set first.

**Cvars:** `r_shadows_cascades` (CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM; 1 = off, 2–4), `r_shadows_cascade_dist` (4096; outermost
reach), `r_shadows_cascade_lambda` (0.85), `r_shadows_cascade_debug` (per-cascade split/radius/texels-per-qu).

**Verified (headless, fy_killzone, `r_shadows_res` 4096):** no crash, shaders compile clean, and the live
debug shows the intended split — cascade 0: 8–260 qu, radius 349, **2.89 texels/qu**; cascade 1: 260–845 qu,
0.92; cascade 2: 845–4096 qu, 0.19. Near field ~3× the far cascade's density and range out to 4096 vs the
single map's ~1900. **Known limitation:** depth range is symmetric with the (tight) XY radius in
`GLBE_SelectDLight`'s shared ORTHO branch, so a distant tall occluder's long shadow at a grazing sun can
weaken in the innermost cascade (the occluder is outside its box). Not visible on a high sun; the fix is a
toward-light Z-extend, deferred so the shared ortho path isn't changed on an untested premise.

### Patch 114a — concentric camera-centred cascades + cross-fade + ambient tint (the "shadows swing when I look around" fix)

The first cut fitted each cascade to a **view-frustum slice** (centre `r_origin + vpn*(dn+df)/2`, radius from
a bounding sphere of the slice corners).  In an FPS that was wrong: the boxes — and the boundary between them
— **swung with the view DIRECTION**, so merely *rotating* the camera slid the shadows across the world and the
huge far cascade whipped around ("shadows move when I look around, corrupt at 3+").  User-reported, correct.

**Fix: concentric, camera-centred cascades.** Every cascade is now centred on the camera POSITION (`r_origin`)
with a geometric radius progression — cascade `s` has radius `outer / ratio^(cascades-1-s)`, so the outermost
is `r_shadows_cascade_dist` and each inner one is `1/ratio` of it.  Rotating no longer moves anything
(`r_origin` is rotation-independent); only translating does, and the Patch-106 whole-texel snap keeps that
shimmer-free.  The frustum-slice fit, its fov/bounding-sphere math, `Sh_CascadeSplit`, and
`r_shadows_cascade_lambda` are all gone; `r_shadows_cascade_dist` default dropped 4096→**2048** and a new
`r_shadows_cascade_ratio` (default 3) tunes the size step.

Measured on fy_killzone (res 4096, 3 cascades): radii **228 / 683 / 2048 qu** at **4.43 / 1.48 / 0.49
texels/qu** — near field now *sharper* than the frustum fit's 2.89, far cascade up from 0.19 (5.3 qu/texel) to
0.49 (2 qu/texel), and none of it swims under rotation.

**Also folded into the shaders** (loose `defaultwall.glsl` / `defaultskin.glsl`, no rebuild):
- **Cross-fade** between adjacent cascades (`r_shadows_cascade_blend`, default 0.8): the outer band of each
  cascade lerps into the next wider one via `cascade_shadow()` helper — kills the hard resolution seam that
  showed as a "cutoff" at cascade boundaries.
- **Ambient shadow tint** (`r_shadows_color_r/g/b`, default 0.5 grey = the old scalar floor): a fully-shadowed
  world pixel is multiplied by this colour, so shadows can sink toward the sky/ambient colour instead of dead
  grey.  Driven per-map by the new `env_sun "shadowcolor"` key (nettest `sv_env_sun.qc`, which stuffs the
  cvars — CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM auto-flush, no vid_reload).  Replaces the scalar `r_shadows_floor` from 114.

### Patch 114b — stale cached render projection: atlas cells 1+ rendered with cell 0's matrix

**Symptom (user-reported, took several rounds to catch):** with `r_shadows_cascades > 1`, cascade 0 (the near
one) was correct but the outer cascades were "mapped incorrectly / a mess." A single carried prop cast **three
separate shadow copies at once**, one per cascade ring, each a different size; a shadow held **constant apparent
screen size** as you backed away from it (instead of shrinking). The `r_shadows_cascade_showsplit` debug showed
the cascade *regions* were perfectly correct.

**Root cause (found by a 4-agent workflow after hand-analysis kept wrongly concluding "the matrices are
correct" — they *are*; the bug is a cache).** The fake-shadow ATLAS renders N cells, each with a **different**
ortho projection, inside ONE `GLBE_BeginShadowMap`/`EndShadowMap` pair. But `GLBE_SelectEntity`
(`gl_backend.c:4399`) only re-copies `r_refdef.m_projection_std` into the cached `shaderstate.projectionmatrix`
inside `if (shaderstate.usingweaponviewmatrix != fl)` — where `fl = flags & (RF_DEPTHHACK|RF_XFLIP)`, which is
**0 for every world/prop caster**. `usingweaponviewmatrix` is reset to -1 only in `GLBE_BeginShadowMap` (once,
before the loop) and `GLBE_EndShadowMap` (once, after) — **never between cells**. So cell 0's first caster
cached cell 0's ortho and set the flag to 0; cells 1..N-1 then saw `fl == 0 == usingweaponviewmatrix`, skipped
the refresh, and rendered their caster **depth** with cell 0's projection while the shader **sampled** each with
its own (correct, captured) matrix. For concentric cascades that scales the stored-vs-sampled ortho by
`radius(0)/radius(s)`, so a caster's shadow is magnified about the eye by `radius(s)/radius(0)` — **1× / 3× /
9×** for the default ratio-3 cascades. The sampling side being correct is exactly why the debug rings looked
perfect while the shadow content was wrong. This also latently affected the P110 direction atlas (slots 1+).

**Fix.** New `GLBE_FlushProjection()` (`gl_backend.c`) sets `shaderstate.usingweaponviewmatrix = -1` — the same
invalidation Begin/EndShadowMap already use — so the next `GLBE_SelectEntity` re-reads the current
`r_refdef.m_projection_std`. Called once per cell, right before the `Sh_GenShadowFace` render, in **both**
`Sh_GenerateCascadeAtlas` and `Sh_GenerateFakeShadowsAtlas`. Declared in `gl/shader.h`. Deliberately NOT placed
in the shared `Sh_GenShadowFace` (which rtlight cube/spot faces also use) — the atlas loops are the only paths
that swap the projection mid-Begin/End, so the fix stays scoped to them.

**Verify:** `r_shadows_cascades 3`; a carried prop now casts ONE consistently-sized shadow, and it shrinks with
distance normally. Discriminating check that isolates *this* bug from the (separate, real) far-cascade
coarseness: at `r_shadows_cascade_ratio 1.0` all cascades share one radius so the magnification is 1× — before
this fix the "3 sizes" vanished at ratio 1; after it, ratio 3 is correctly sized too.

**Still open (separate quality issue, not this bug):** the equal 2×2 cell layout gives every cascade the same
texel count while radii grow ×3, so the far cascade is ~8× coarser than the old single map. That's a
resolution/texel-budget follow-up (bigger atlas, per-cascade PCF scaling, or view-fitted far cascades), not a
correctness bug.

## Maintenance 2026-07-23 — model_t APPEND-ONLY restored (the "all HL2/CSS maps stall" incident)  *(APPLIED, `m-rel`+`sv-rel`+ALL plugins)*

**Symptom:** every Source map (HL2 VBSP / CSS) stalled or crashed at load, with nothing in the log. Quake
maps fine. Started silently at some point; user couldn't date it.

**Root cause:** the Patch 56/61 convex-hull fields (`numhullplanes/hullplanes/numhulltris/hulltris/
numhulls/convhulls`, 48 bytes) were inserted into the **middle** of `model_t` (before `clipbox`),
violating the struct's own APPEND-ONLY comments. VBSP loading lives in `plugins/hl2/mod_vbsp.c`, which
compiles `gl_model.h` into `fteplug_hl2_x64.dll` — the deployed DLL predated the insertion (built Jun 15),
so on a newer exe every `model_t` member it touches (`surfaces`, `planes`, `textures`, `lightdata`,
`funcs.*`, the embedded `batches[]`, `memgroup`) was read/written **48 bytes off**: `GMalloc(&mod->memgroup)`
built the allocation chain inside the wrong bytes of the struct, `Mod_Batches_Build` read garbage surface
pointers → stall/crash on the first VBSP map. `fteplug_cod` had the identical exposure for CoD maps.
It was silent because the plugin gate (`plugin.c` `PlugBI_GetEngineInterface` + `MODPLUGFUNCS_VERSION` in
`com_mesh.h`) only checks the function table, never data-struct layout.

**Fix:** moved the six fields to the **tail** of `model_t` (after `sunvisdata`) in `gl_model.h`, with a
comment recording the incident; rebuilt exe + `fteqwsv64` + all four native plugins together and deployed
as a set. Headless-verified: `d1_trainstation_01` (HL2), `de_dust2` (CSS) and `2fort` (Quake, Box3D up)
all reach "Server spawned." on the dedicated server.

**Standing rule going forward** (also in the Build/deploy section above): any change to a plugin-visible
struct — and in practice ANY engine rebuild — means rebuilding + redeploying all native plugins. Delete
`engine/release/fteplug_*_x64.dll` first after header changes; the plugin makefiles don't track engine
headers.

**Follow-up A (build-system trap, same day):** the first "fixed" exe SIGSEGV'd anyway — FTE's make does
not track engine-header deps, so `make m-rel` after the gl_model.h change rebuilt only 7/213 client
objects = an exe mixing old- and new-layout code (crash under `VBSP_GenerateMaterials`). See the RULE +
forced-full-rebuild note in the Build/deploy section. Also: Q3/botlib objects in `release/m_mgw64` build
from `plugins/quake3/` — touching only `engine/` misses them.

**Follow-up B (`s_shadowmap` C1503, `gl_shader.c` `Com_PermuOrFloatArgument`):** cold-starting straight
into a map (`+map` / cl_launchintogame) parsed every world program's `!!samps =FAKESHADOWS shadowmap`
while the `r_fakeshadows` global was still false (it only flips in a rendered 3D frame,
`gl_shadow.c:5688`) → no `s_shadowmap` uniform → when the FAKESHADOWS define later reached a
permutation, GLSL compile died `C1503 undefined variable "s_shadowmap"` (surfaced on the hl2 plugin's
`vmt/lightmapped#ENVFROMMASK`). Fix: the samps condition now also accepts the cvar intent
(`r_fakeshadows || r_shadows.ival == 2`) — declaring the never-bound sampler is free, all usage stays
behind `#ifdef FAKESHADOWS`.

**Verified end-to-end** (client under gdb, cold `+map`): `d1_trainstation_01`, `de_dust2`, `2fort` —
0 signals, 0 shader/host errors, in-game with Box3D up, on both the client and the dedicated server.

---

## Patch 115 — Box3D rejected any prop hull over ~44 verts, then retried it every frame  *(APPLIED — `plugins-rel NATIVE_PLUGINS=box3d`, win64 + linux64)*

**Symptom.** Loading `2fort` on the dedicated server printed hundreds of lines of

```
Box3D: hull final half edge count of 316 exceeds limit of 255
Box3D: hull final face count of 403 exceeds limit of 255
Box3D: hull final vertex count of 255 exceeds limit of 255
```

and kept printing them for the life of the server.

**Cause 1 — the cap was wrong by ~6x.** Box3D index-encodes a finished hull with `uint8_t`, so
vertices, faces *and* half-edges must each stay under 255 (`hull.c`, `B3_HULL_LIMIT`). `b3CreateHull`
does not simplify or truncate on overflow — all three checks `b3Free(...); return NULL;`. Only the
VERTEX count is budgeted (`hull.c:1429`); faces and half-edges fall out of the geometry, and the
builder enforces Euler's identity (`v - e + f == 2`), so half-edges `H = 2(V+F-2)`. A triangulated
hull — what organic prop meshes produce — has `F = 2V-4`, giving `H = 6V-12`. `H <= 254` therefore
needs **`V <= 44`**, but `com_phys_box3d.c` asked for up to 255 at both call sites. The reported 316
half-edges back-solves exactly to a 55-vertex hull. Asking for 255 is self-defeating on its own: the
budget permits 255 and the builder then rejects at `>= 255`, hence the absurd "vertex count of 255
exceeds limit of 255".

Measured over the shipped `.acd` sidecars: 34% of decomposition pieces already exceed 44 verts
(median 35, p90 84, max 445), so this fired constantly.

**Cause 2 — the failure path was destructive AND self-repeating.** The decomposition path degraded a
failed piece to its AABB (playable, but it quietly defeats the entire point of decomposition). The
single-hull path did `World_Box3D_RemoveFromEntity(world, ed); return;` — which leaves the prop with
**no collision at all**, and clears `ed->rbe.physics`, which is the very flag the rebuild gate at
`com_phys_box3d.c:407` tests. `World_Box3D_Frame` walks every edict each frame, so the full quickhull
over thousands of points re-ran, re-failed and re-logged **every frame, forever**. The same file
already knew this trap — the `GenerateCollisionMesh` failure above it says "do NOT RemoveFromEntity or
we re-spam every frame".

**Fix** (`engine/common/com_phys_box3d.c`):
- `#define BOX3D_MAXHULLVERTS 44`, derived above, used at both `b3CreateHull` call sites.
- The single-hull failure now falls back to a solid box built from the collision verts' own AABB — the
  same "never drop a piece" trick the decomposition path uses, and in the same space (`vertex3f` is
  already body-local) so it cannot be misplaced. If even that degenerates, return with `physics` left
  true so the gate stays shut instead of looping.

**Verified.** `fteqwsv64.exe -game quakers +map 2fort`: **301 log lines before, 0 after**, with
`sv_writecvars` confirming the map actually loaded and QC `StartFrame` ran. Do not raise
`BOX3D_MAXHULLVERTS` without re-deriving it against `hull.c`.

## Patch 116 — map index tagged with a hardcoded gamedir, emptying the Create Server map list  *(APPLIED — `m-rel` + `sv-rel`)*

`FS_IndexAddonMaps` wrote the tag for the mod's own (non-addon) maps as the string literal
`"nettest"`, so it did not follow the `nettest` -> `quakers` gamedir rename. The menu's
`create_server_map_game()` matches on the gamedir name, stopped recognising them, and they fell
through to its HL2 default — the Net tab came up empty even though all 1,624 maps were indexed
correctly (they were showing under HL2). Now derived from `gamedirfile`, so a future rename cannot
desync the two again. `menu/m_createserver.qc` also accepts both spellings, so the mod works against
a stock engine build too.

## Patch 117 — crash handler logged into a directory that no longer exists  *(APPLIED — `m-rel` + `sv-rel`)*

`client/sys_win.c` and `server/sv_sys_win.c` both wrote crash addresses to
`C:\FTEQuake\nettest\crashaddr.txt`. That gamedir is now `quakers`, and `CreateFileA` does not create
missing directories, so every crash address and stack dump this handler exists to capture was being
silently discarded. Repointed at `C:\FTEQuake\quakers\crashaddr.txt`.

## Patch 118 — in-game delta updater (`update_check` / `update_apply`)  *(APPLIED — full rebuild + all four plugins)*

**New files:** `common/blake2b.c`, `common/qkupdate.c`, `common/qkupdate.h`.
**Modified:** `common/common.h`, `common/fs.c`, `common/common.c`, `client/m_download.c`,
`client/cl_main.c`, `server/sv_main.c`, `Makefile`.

**Why:** content ships as a content-addressed tree on Cloudflare R2 (manifest + `objects/<hh>/<hash>`,
BLAKE2b-256) and the Rust launcher installs it. The gap was never capability, it was **discovery** —
a player already in the game had no way to learn a new build existed without quitting and re-running
the launcher. The engine now checks when the map-backdrop main menu opens and applies small deltas
in place. First-time installs, full repairs and anything touching the engine binaries still refuse
and hand off to the launcher.

**Not FTE's own package manager.** `m_download.c` models *packages*, hard-wires its hash keys to
sha1/sha512 (`:1310`), and `PM_SignatureOkay` refuses arbitrary loose files. Adopting it would mean
repackaging 4,243 loose files into pk3s and losing per-file dedup. Its *parts* are reused instead:
`FS_Hash_ValidateWrites` (hoisted here to `fs.c`), `HTTP_CL_Get`, `DL_CreateThread`, `VFSPIPE_Open`.

**`blake2b.c`** must match RustCrypto's `Blake2b<U32>` exactly — RFC 7693 with the parameter block's
digest_length set to 32 (`h[0] ^= 0x01010020`), **not** a truncated BLAKE2b-512. The hash can never
change: object names *are* the hashes, so switching renames every R2 object and forces a 6.3 GB
re-download for everyone. Registered in `COM_CalcHash_Thread`, so `fs_hash <file>` is the oracle.

**Three placements that are not obvious and must not be "tidied":**

1. `QKU_ReplayJournal()` sits in `FS_ChangeGame` right after `FS_CleanDir(com_gamepath,…)`, **not**
   at the tail of `COM_InitFilesystem` — `com_gamepath` is not assigned until then, so the obvious
   spot is a silent no-op. It is run-once guarded because later calls happen with packs open.
2. Download callbacks `Cmd_AddTimer` to the main thread rather than acting directly:
   `notifycomplete` fires from inside `HTTP_CL_Think` with arbitrary engine state on the stack.
3. Apply never calls `FS_ReloadPackFiles` (`fs.c` flags it "potentially unsafe"). It relies on the
   Win32 asymmetry that a locked file cannot be deleted but *can* be renamed, then
   `FS_FlushFSHashFull()`. Note `Sys_Rename` is `MoveFileW` **without** `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`,
   so every rename-over is preceded by `FS_Remove`.

**The updater writes back to `.quakers-launcher/state.json`.** Skipping that is not cosmetic: the
launcher would still hold the old hashes and re-download everything the engine just installed, and
the two would then disagree about what is on disk. `version` is bumped only when the whole plan
landed; individual paths are recorded as they land.

**Verified** against live `dl.proto.bar` on a real launcher install at `2026.07.27_1617`: delta
computed as exactly the 4 changed files, downloaded, hash-verified, installed, ledger updated to
`2026.07.27_1727`, and the launcher independently confirmed 4,235/4,238 correct afterwards.
`fs_hash` output matches Python `hashlib.blake2b(digest_size=32)` on sizes 0/1/63/64/65/127/128/129/
255/256/257 B, 4 KB, 1 MB, 7.9 MB and on 16 real published objects including a 473 MB pk3.

**One bug worth remembering:** the manifest reader called `strlen()` on a buffer before writing its
terminator. At boot the allocation lands on fresh zeroed pages and it passes; called later off a
dirty heap it rejects a perfectly good manifest with a bare "http 200". Terminate, then measure.

## Patch 119 — `cfg/` accepted as a writable QC prefix, so the mod can keep every config in one folder  *(APPLIED — `m-rel` + `sv-rel`; no header change, plugins unaffected)*

**Files:** `common/pr_bgcmd.c`, `common/fs.c`, `common/cmd.c`, `client/cl_main.c`, `server/sv_main.c`.

**The problem, and why it was not a mod-side one.** Quakers had *two* sets of configs —
`quakers/default.cfg`, `server.cfg`, `ftesrv.cfg` at the gamedir root **and** the same three names
again under `quakers/data/`. That was not sloppiness, it was forced by the engine:

- `QC_FixFileName` (`pr_bgcmd.c:2605`) rewrites **every** QC `fopen`/`fcopy`/`frename`/`fremove`
  in all three VMs so writes land under `data/`. The builtin's own doc string says so
  (`server/pr_cmds.c:12303`).
- `QC_PathRequiresSandbox` (`:2584`) makes any `*.cfg` at the gamedir **root** unreadable by QC.

So the root copies were the ones the engine execs at boot and QC cannot see; the `data/` copies
were the only ones QC could read or write. Two locations was the only arrangement that worked.

**The change.** `cfg/` is now accepted as a *second* pass-through writable prefix alongside
`data/` — one extra `strncmp`. Additive on purpose: `data/` is what every other FTE mod uses.
`cfg/` is neither root-level nor `configs/`, so it also falls outside the read sandbox, which is
what lets QC read the same files it writes. Security: this widens the QC write sandbox by exactly
one directory, and the exposure is unchanged in practice — QC could already write configs under
`data/` and the menu already exec'd one of them.

Supporting changes so nothing is left behind in `data/`:
- `FS_MAPS_INDEX` (`fs.c`) → `cfg/maps_index.txt`.
- `cmd.c:4177` `saveconfig` `nohidden` heuristic extended to `cfg/`.
- `cl_main.c` / `sv_main.c` boot exec now **prefer** `cfg/default.cfg` / `cfg/server.cfg` /
  `cfg/ftesrv.cfg`, falling back to the gamedir-root names when absent — via the same
  `COM_FileSize` idiom `sv_main.c` already used. Stock games and a `cfg`-less install boot
  unchanged; verified by hiding `cfg/` and confirming a clean fall back, exit 0.
- `fs.c` re-exec watchlist gained `cfg/default.cfg` + `cfg/server.cfg`.

**Trap that bit during the merge.** The root `default.cfg` carries `seta vid_*`, and its own
header explains those must be captured during early boot. Merging it with `data/default.cfg`
(which the menu VM exec'd at init) meant one file exec'd twice — so every menu-VM init would have
reset the player's saved resolution to 1024x768 windowed. Fixed by dropping the menu's re-exec
(`menu/m_menu.qc` `Menu_LoadConfig`); the engine's boot exec still runs before
`cfg/settings.cfg`, so the "defaults first, user settings second" ordering is preserved.

Also removed `CSQC_RegenerateSpraysShader`'s file write: it wrote `data/scripts/sprays.shader`,
which the renderer never read (sprays go through `shaderforname` — the function's own comment
documented the bug), and it would have re-created a stray `data/` on every map load.

**Verified** on `C:\FTEQuake`: after the move, a client boot writes `cfg/maps_index.txt` (engine)
and `cfg/settings.cfg` (menu QC `fopen`) and **no `data/` directory reappears**;
`cl_download_redirection 1` and `vid_width 1024` confirm the merged boot block ran; box3d/hl2/cod
all load; the dedicated server execs `cfg/server.cfg` + `cfg/ftesrv.cfg`.

## Patch 120 — model shadows: casters always reach the sun, sticky lamp pick, constant cell size  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shadow.c` (the bulk), `engine/gl/gl_shader.c` (one clamp).
No header change, so the native plugins are unaffected and were **not** rebuilt.

**Why.** Three independent instabilities in `r_shadows 2` that together read as "shadow quality is
all over the place":

1. **A player's sun shadow vanished near local lights, and CROUCHING brought it back.** Two gates
   deleted a caster from the sun cascades and nothing put it back:
   - `Sh_FakeShadowFilter`'s sun branch admitted only `fs_entbucket[i] == 0`, so the moment a lamp
     cell claimed a prop it was removed from **every** sun cascade — replaced by a lamp cone that
     might be aimed elsewhere, washed out by the sunmask, or (several edge paths) never rendered.
   - `r_shadows_caster_sunvis` (0.3) dropped any caster whose baked dominant light was >72° off the
     sun, replaced by nothing at all.

   Both keyed off a single point rigidly offset from `e->origin`. Ducking lowers the player's origin
   by exactly 18qu (`sh_pmove.qc` `PM_DUCK_MINS`), the only crouch-sensitive input the engine has:
   enough to swing the lamp-direction vector 10-20° for a nearby lamp and to push the shin probe
   from `feet+8` to `feet-10`, i.e. through the floor plane. That flipped the claim, and the shadow
   reappeared.

2. **The projecting lamp kept swapping.** `Sh_PropDominantLamp` was stateless with no dead-band, so
   two comparable lamps flipped the instant a prop crossed their `bright²/dist²` iso-surface. It
   traced only the top **3** candidates and returned −1 when all three were occluded, so walking
   past a railing dropped the shadow entirely for a frame even with a fourth visible lamp in range.

3. **Lamp cell resolution was a step function of the LIVE cell count.** At `cascades 3` +
   `worldmask 1` the quarter/eighth tier flipped at 2 lamps, so a third lamp coming into view
   instantly **quartered the pixel area of every lamp shadow on screen**.

Also found: the candidacy loop hard-bailed when `R_EntityDominantLightDir` failed, which killed the
whole per-light feature on any map built without `light -bspxlux` — **22 of the mod's 29 maps** —
even though on a SUNVIS-baked map the direction was already unused (`minalign` forced to `-2`).

**What changed.**

- **Additive, not exclusive.** New `fs_propshadowpass` static; while the propshadow atlas renders,
  `Sh_FakeShadowFilter`'s sun branch admits every caster. Lamp cells were already by-cone, so a
  caster now renders into the sun cascades **and** any lamp cone containing it, and the shader
  accumulates the two terms separately. Nothing left to classify, nothing left to flicker. The
  `r_shadows_slots > 1` direction atlas is genuinely exclusive (one quantised direction per caster)
  and keeps its `fs_entbucket` filter — that is what the new flag distinguishes.
- **`r_shadows_caster_sunvis` now defaults to 0.**
- **In-shade classification deleted** from `Sh_GeneratePropShadowsAtlas`: no SUNVIS threshold, no
  deluxemap-dot fallback, `minalign` always `-2`. The deluxemap direction is diagnostic only, so
  lamp shadows work on all 29 maps. Where a SUNVIS bake exists, the sunmask term still fades a lamp
  shadow across sunlit ground — a smooth per-pixel falloff instead of a hard per-entity switch,
  which is where that decision belongs.
- **`SH_LAMPCANDS` 3 → 8**, and an all-occluded trace now falls back to the best-scoring lamp
  instead of returning −1. Factored out `Sh_PropLampVisible` / `Sh_PropLampScore`.
- **`Sh_PropStickyLamp`**: a 4096-bucket table keyed and *validated* on `keynum` (mirroring the
  Patch-105 model-light cache) holding each caster's current lamp. A challenger must out-score the
  incumbent by `r_shadows_propshadows_switch` (**new cvar**, default 2) to take over, and 3 frames
  of lost line-of-sight are tolerated first. Cleared when `sh_maplights` is rebuilt, since lamp
  indices change meaning on map load.
- **`sh_propsub_budget`**: the subcell tier is chosen from the *budget* (`propmax`), not the live
  count, so cell resolution never steps. The atlas reserves space it may not use, which is free —
  unused cells are already pushed past the far plane and never sampled.
- **`gl_shader.c`**: its `FAKESHADOWS_COUNT` clamp was missing the worldmask halving that
  `Sh_GeneratePropShadowsAtlas` applies, so at `cascades 3` + `worldmask 1` the shader compiled 13
  perspective cells while the engine could only fill 8. The 5 dead slots still cost a loop iteration
  (5 depth taps) per pixel on every wall and model plus their share of the 16 mat4 uniforms uploaded
  per draw. `r_shadows_propshadows_worldmask` had to lose `static` for this.

**Debug line changed** — `sunlit=` is gone (always 0 now); it reports `held=` / `swapped=` instead,
which is what you want when tuning `_switch`.

**Watch for:** on the 26 maps with no SUNVIS bake the sunmask is forced off, so a prop in bright
sunlight near a lamp now casts a lamp shadow as well as its sun shadow. `r_shadows_propshadows_range`
(lamp reach = brightness × this) is the dial for that — not the classifier, which is what was
flickering.

**Companion cfg changes** (`C:\FTEQuake\quakers\cfg\default.cfg`): `r_shadows_res` 4096 → 8192
(three 4096 cascades + a constant 1024 per lamp cell, ~256MB depth), `r_shadows_caster_sunvis` → 0,
`r_shadows_selfshadow_cascadebias` 0 → 1 (it was fighting the shader's own default of 1; at 0 the
model self-shadow bias is flat across cascades whose texels are 1:3:9, which banded distant props),
and `r_shadows_cascade_blend` set to 0.85 — it had never been set, so it ran on the shader default
0, and since the blend factor is a Chebyshev distance ≥0.5 everywhere inside a cascade box, **every
pixel in the near cascades was more than half blended toward the coarser cascade's fatter penumbra,
at 24 PCF taps instead of 12.**

### Patch 120a — revert "always both", fixed per-lamp cones, mapper-flagged shadow lights  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shadow.c`, `engine/gl/gl_backend.c` (`SP_E_SUNDIR` only).

Patch 120 made the sun and lamp shadows **additive** to stop a player's sun shadow vanishing near
lamps. That fixed the flicker but was the wrong call: a prop standing under a roof then cast a hard
sun shadow *and* carried a sun form-shade on top of its lamp shadow — "the shadows don't make any
sense indoors". The real defect in the old code was never the exclusivity, it was that the verdict
was recomputed from one probe luxel every frame with no hysteresis.

- **Exclusivity restored, debounced.** `Sh_PropShadeState` holds each caster's in-shade verdict and
  only lets it flip after `SH_STICKYLAMP_SHADE` (6) consecutive frames of the opposite answer. An
  in-shade caster is stamped into `fs_entbucket` and so leaves the sun cascades; a sunlit one keeps
  its sun shadow. A map with neither bake cannot answer, and those props keep both — there is no
  information to do better with, and dropping either would lose a feature outright.
  `r_shadows_caster_sunvis` goes back to `0.3` (it is the no-SUNVIS fallback, not a blanket gate).
- **Form-shade follows the lamp.** `SP_E_SUNDIR` now asks `Sh_EntityLampDir` first. The deluxemap
  reconstruction it used before only exists on 6 of 29 maps, so everywhere else the "per-prop
  dominant light" silently fell back to the global sun — a prop indoors was form-shaded by a sun it
  cannot see while its lamp shadow pointed the other way. Cast shadow, self-shadow and form-shade
  now all come from the same lamp, with no bake required.
- **Cones are FIXED per lamp, resolved at load.** Was: aim = the running mean of whichever props were
  in the cell, fov = refitted to the widest member, both recomputed every frame — which is why the
  atlas tile panned and zoomed with the player and why one prop joining a cell shifted every other
  shadow in it. Now `Sh_LoadMapLights` parses the ericw spotlight keys:
  - `mangle` ("yaw pitch roll" → `(cos p·cos y, cos p·sin y, sin p)`, the direction light TRAVELS)
  - `target` → aimed at that entity's origin (resolved by a first pass over `targetname`), which
    takes precedence over `mangle`, matching ericw
  - `angle` (cone **diameter**, q1) or `_cone` (**radius**, q2 — doubled)
  - neither aim key → **straight down**; no angle key → `r_shadows_propshadows_cone` (**new cvar**,
    default 120°)

  Clustering is gone with it: one cell per lamp, so `SH_CELLJOINANG`, `pc_dir`, `pc_angrad` and
  `lc_aim` are all deleted. `nearclip` is a constant 8 and `zfar` is the lamp's reach.
- **`_shadow` / `_shadowcast` light key.** If a map flags at least one light, only flagged lights
  cast prop shadows on that map; if none are flagged, all of them do exactly as before. So no
  existing map needs editing, and flagging one light turns the map into a whitelist.
- **One eligibility test.** Whitelist, reach and the fixed cone all live in `Sh_PropLampScore`, which
  the ranking, the stickiness comparison and the incumbent check all call — they cannot disagree
  about which lamps are usable, so a prop can no longer be assigned to a lamp whose cone can never
  contain it (which would leave it with no shadow at all).

**Fixed while here:** `pc_shade[npc]` was being written before the `npc < SH_MAXPROPCANDS` bounds
check — a 257th candidate would have written one past the array.

**Debug line** now reports `inshade=` alongside `held=` / `swapped=`.

### Patch 120b — lamp shadows never landed on the world; no-bake in-shade classification  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shadow.c`, and the mod's `glsl/defaultwall.glsl` (shader-only, no rebuild
needed for that half).

Two separate defects, both reported as *"my shadow from local lights only projects onto other props,
it doesn't project onto the world"* and *"the sun atlas still shows a player mask when I stand over a
prop_static inside"*.

**1. The world-occlusion mask rejected every world surface (the `props only` bug).**
`r_shadows_propshadows_worldmask 1` gives each lamp cell a paired depth render of the *world* through
the same cone, and the receiver multiplies its lamp darkening by `worldlit`. The compare was

```glsl
float fswz = fsc.z + float(r_shadows_propshadows_worldbias);   // 0.003
worldlit = (stored_world_depth >= fswz);
```

For a **world** receiver the stored first-surface depth *is this pixel*, so the test read
`d >= d + bias` — always false. `worldlit` was 0 on every world surface and the lamp shadow was
multiplied out of existence. **Models** were untouched because they sit in front of the stored world
depth, which is exactly why the shadows landed on props and nothing else. Nothing compensated in the
other direction either: `slotmat[14] -= r_shadows_propshadows_bias` is a constant subtraction from
clip-z, so after the perspective divide it is only `bias/d` ≈ 4e-6 at 200qu; and the depth pass'
polygon offset is `glPolygonOffset(0, 0.05)` ≈ 3e-9 on a 24-bit buffer. (Note `renderer.c:404-405`
registers those two cvars under each other's names — the C identifier `..._offset` is the cvar named
`..._factor`. Left alone; it is stock FTE and nothing here depends on it.)

Fixed by flipping the sign so the margin favours **lit**, and re-expressing it in **quake units**
rather than raw depth — a constant depth margin is ~4× too tight at 100qu and ~4× too loose at 400qu,
so no single value can cover a cone.

The lamp frustum's near plane is a fixed 8 and zfar is the lamp's reach, so with `k = f/(f−n)`:

```
z01      = k·(1 − n/d)          dz01/dd = k·n/d²          1 − z01 = n·(f−d)/((f−n)·d)
```

The tempting shorthand `D·(1−z01)²/n` is **not** `D·dz01/dd` — substituting the exact `1−z01` gives
`D·n·(f−d)²/((f−n)²d²)`, short of the true value by `k·(1−d/f)²`. That is 0.31× at half the lamp's
reach and **zero at the far plane**, which would have brought the world shadows back near a lamp and
left them missing further out — the same bug with a smaller radius. `pc.w` already *is* `d/reach`
(the engine normalises the whole slot matrix by `rad`), so dividing by `(1−pc.w)²` restores it
exactly with no extra uniform:

```glsl
float wbase = float(r_shadows_propshadows_worldbias) * (1.0-fsc.z)*(1.0-fsc.z) * 0.125;  //0.125 = 1/nearclip
float wrem  = 1.0 - pc.w;
float fswz  = fsc.z - wbase / max(1e-4, wrem*wrem);
```

Checked against the exact form at both ends: 1.8 % over at d=200 and at d=400 with f=450. `k` is
dropped deliberately — it runs 1.00…1.14 across the reach range and over-delivering margin is the
fail-safe direction. **`r_shadows_propshadows_worldbias` therefore changes units: 0.003 → 4 (quake
units); usable band ~4–8.** The trade it now states honestly: a wall thinner than *D* along the light
ray still leaks. At `r_shadows_res 8192` the ±1-texel PCF slope error on a floor lit at 20° grazing
is ~1.9qu, so 4 has better than 2× headroom; drop to eighth-size cells at a lower `_res` and it
tightens proportionally.

**Known asymmetry, deliberately left:** `defaultskin.glsl`'s perspective block has no world-mask term
at all, so lamp shadows can still project through a wall onto a *model* in the next room. Adding it
needs `l_fakeshadowinfo` plumbed into that shader; out of scope here.
> **This turned out NOT to be benign — see Patch 120c, which ports the mask across.** It is the
> "second smaller silhouette on a prop_static" report: the world rejected a through-geometry lamp
> projection and the model standing in it did not, so the ghost appeared on props and nowhere else.

**2. In-shade classification needed a bake the map probably doesn't have.**
`rawshade` could only be computed from a SUNVIS lump, or from a deluxemap via
`r_shadows_caster_sunvis`. With neither it stayed `-1`, nothing was stamped into `fs_entbucket`, and
`Sh_FakeShadowFilter` kept admitting the caster into the sun cascades — so on any map built without
`light -bspxlux -sunvis` (most of them) a player under a roof still cast a full sun shadow.

New `Sh_PropSunOccluded()` answers the same question from geometry, on every map: trace from the
caster's **mid-height** toward the sun and call it in shade if a solid world surface is overhead. The
mask is `MASK_WORLDSOLID|FTECONTENTS_SKY` and the outcome is read off `trace.contents`:

- nothing hit → sunlit;
- stopped in a **sky** leaf → sunlit;
- anything else → in shade.

Sky has to be *in* the mask: a q1 sky brush is a thin shell with solid void behind it
(`q1bsp.c` maps `Q1CONTENTS_SKY` → `FTECONTENTS_SKY`, which `MASK_WORLDSOLID` excludes), so a
sky-blind trace sails through the shell, stops on that void and reports "roof" for everything
outdoors. `TI_SKY` is accepted too, for formats where sky brushes are solid. `startsolid`/`allsolid`
return "unknown" so a buried probe changes nothing. The probe is mid-height rather than the
ground-contact point the lamp traces use — `sp` sits 8qu above the model's lowest extent, close
enough to the floor that a prop resting flush reads `startsolid`.

Runs only for casters that already passed the cheap lamp range gate, and only when neither bake
answered. **New cvar `r_shadows_propshadows_suntrace`** (default 1) turns it off.

**Also fixed, both found while verifying the above:**

- **`r_shadows_propshadows_worldmask` was a plain `CVARD`** while `gl_shader.c:1527/1588` reads it to
  halve the cell cap that produces `FAKESHADOWS_COUNT`. Toggling it changed the engine's live budget
  immediately and left the compiled loop bounds stale until the next `vid_reload` — which silently
  invalidated every A/B test of the mask itself. Now `CVARFD(..., CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM, ...)`, matching
  `_slots` / `_cascades` / `_propshadows` / `_max`.
- **`Sh_PropShadeState` bypassed its own debounce on a dropout.** `if (raw < 0 || …) return raw;`
  returned −1 *before* the hysteresis, so one frame the classifier could not answer popped a settled
  in-shade caster straight back into the sun with a full sun shadow. The 6-frame debounce only ever
  protected 0↔1. A dropout now holds the last stable verdict; a caster never yet classified still
  returns −1, so a map with no bake and `_suntrace 0` behaves exactly as before.

**Known limits of the new classifier**, none of which existed to be wrong before:

- The trace tests `cl.worldmodel` only, so a roof made of a **brush entity** (`func_wall`,
  `func_door`, a lift) reads as open sky and the caster keeps its sun shadow.
- A **fully sealed map with no sky brushes** now classifies every caster as in-shade. That is the
  right answer (no sun reaches it), but on such a map every model leaves the sun cascades.
- The verdict is one point sample, so it has a hard edge where SUNVIS gives a gradient. The 6-frame
  debounce covers the flutter; crossing a real shadow boundary pops rather than fades.
- `MASK_WORLDSOLID` includes `FTECONTENTS_WINDOW`, so glass counts as a roof.

**Known limits of the world mask**, now visible for the first time because `worldlit` finally does
something: the world depth mesh is world-only (`Sh_FakeShadowFilter` rejects every visedict under
`FS_WORLDSLOT`), so **brush-model entities are not in it** and lamp shadows still project through a
closed `func_door`. `defaultskin.glsl` has no world-mask term at all, so the same is true of any
model receiver. Neither is new; both were simply unreachable while `worldlit` was pinned at 0.

**Not fixed, noted:** `r_polygonoffset_shadowmap_{offset,factor}` are registered under each other's
names (`renderer.c:404-405`), so the pipeline runs `glPolygonOffset(0, 0.05)` where `(0.05, 0)` was
meant — no slope-scaled term on any shadowmap depth render, and tuning either cvar moves the other.
Stock FTE; nothing here depends on it, but it is why `worldbias` has to absorb the whole slope error
alone. Likewise `r_shadows_throwfade` is baked into the shader by `gl_shader.c:1549` without being
`CVAR_SHADERSYSTEM`, so changing it needs a manual `vid_reload`.

**Companion cfg changes** (`C:\FTEQuake\quakers\cfg\default.cfg`): `r_shadows_propshadows_worldbias`
0.003 → **4** (units changed — do not carry the old value forward), and
`set r_shadows_propshadows_suntrace 1` added.

### Patch 120c — the ghost silhouette, and a continuous sun/shade transition  *(APPLIED — m-rel)*

**Files:** `engine/gl/gl_shadow.c`, `engine/gl/gl_backend.c`, `engine/gl/gl_shader.c`, `engine/gl/shader.h`,
`engine/d3d/d3d_backend.c`, `engine/d3d/d3d8_backend.c`, and the mod's `glsl/defaultskin.glsl`.

Two reports: *"a second smaller player projection on a prop_static indoors"*, and *"the transition
between outside/inside could be smoother on the sun-shade / self-shadowing front"*.

**1. The second silhouette — the world mask existed only in `defaultwall.glsl`.**

Patch 120b noted that `defaultskin.glsl` had no world-occlusion term and left it as a "known
asymmetry". It is not benign. Lamp-cell caster admission is pure cone geometry with **no
line-of-sight test** (`Sh_FakeShadowFilter`'s `fs_curslot > 0` branch), so a lamp behind a wall or
one floor up projects a caster through solid geometry. The **world** rejected that projection via
`worldlit`; a **model** had nothing to reject it with. Hence a ghost that appeared on the prop and
on nothing around it, and smaller — a longer lamp→caster distance means less projective
magnification.

Fixed by porting the mask into `defaultskin.glsl`: `l_fakeshadowinfo` declared (the engine already
uploads it to any program that asks), the `fsampw` macro added, and the `worldlit` block inserted
into the lamp loop with 120b's corrected sign and `(1-pc.w)²` margin. The two shaders must stay in
step; the long comment lives in `defaultwall.glsl`.

Also corrected the design note at the top of `defaultskin.glsl`, which still claimed "a model is
rendered into exactly ONE cell". True of the P110 direction histogram, invalidated by Patch 120a's
by-cone admission. Casting into every cone you are inside is **kept** — two lamps that can genuinely
see you should give two shadows, which is what the world already does.

**2. The transition was a switch, and it switched the wrong things together.**

One binary `inshade` flag governed the cast shadow, the self-shadow and the form-shade at once. And
the quantity that actually jumped was the form-shade **direction**: `SP_E_SUNDIR` hard-selected
between the lamp vector and the sun vector in a single frame, and `defaultskin.glsl` maps
`N·sundir` across `r_shadows_sunshade_floor`…`_ceil` — 0…2 as shipped, so a model could swing 0×→2×
in that one frame. Every hysteresis in the file (`SH_STICKYLAMP_SHADE`, `_MISSES`, `_switch`,
`_EXPIRE`) only *delays* a flip; none makes one gradual.

- **New per-entity uniform `e_sunshade`**, 0 = fully sunlit … 1 = fully under a roof. Polarity is
  deliberate: an unbound uniform reads 0 in GLSL, so every failure mode lands on "today's
  behaviour", matching `e_noshadowrecv` / `e_fpfade`. An "exposure" scalar where 0 meant shade would
  black out every model if a bind ever failed.
- `sh_stickylamp_t` gains `float shade` + `shadeinit`; `Sh_PropShadeFraction()` approaches the
  frame's target exponentially with time constant **`r_shadows_sunfade` (new cvar, 0.25 s)**, so the
  fade is framerate-independent. 120b's dropout rule carries over — a frame that cannot answer holds.
- **The continuous input that was being discarded.** `R_PointSunVis` returns a real 0..1 and the
  classification threw it away on the next line by thresholding it. It is now kept and remapped
  piecewise so `r_shadows_propshadows_sunvis` stays exactly the half-way point — the discrete verdict
  and the fraction therefore cross over together and cannot disagree. Maps with no SUNVIS lump get a
  0/1 target and the time-smoothing alone.
- **`SP_E_SUNDIR` now blends** lamp↔sun by the same fraction instead of selecting. This also settles
  a real inconsistency: `Sh_EntityLampDir` keys on `e->lamp` alone and never on the in-shade verdict,
  so a *sunlit* prop merely standing near a lamp was already being form-shaded by that lamp while
  casting from the sun. At shade 0 the direction is now the sun regardless.
- The shader fades **only** the sun self-shadow and the sun form-shade. The lamp block is untouched
  on purpose — a prop indoors keeps its lamp shadow at full strength.

**Structural change, load-bearing.** The classification moved *above* the lamp range gate, and
`&& sh_nummaplights` was lifted out of the candidacy loop header down to just before the lamp pick.
The loop body now produces a value the forward pass needs for **every** caster; under the old order
anything not standing near a map lamp bailed at the range gate and was never classified — which is
most casters, and all of them on a lamp-less map. `Sh_EntitySunShade` returns 0 for anything stale or
unclassified, so the five paths on which `Sh_GeneratePropShadowsAtlas` may not run at all
(`r_fakeshadows` lag, `r_lightprepass`, two culls, `r_shadows_slots > 1`) all land on "unchanged".

**3. Always cast into the sun — `r_shadows_propshadows_suncast` (new cvar, default 1).**

With the receive-side fade in place, an in-shade caster no longer has to *leave* the sun cascades to
look right, so it now keeps throwing its sun shadow onto the world indoors. One cvar governs both
exclusions — the `fs_entbucket` stamp and the `r_shadows_caster_sunvis` Phase-0 gate in
`Sh_FakeShadowFilter` — because they answer the same question and splitting them would let
deluxemapped maps keep evicting casters silently. `0` restores Patch 120a exactly.

> **This is one change, not two.** Left in the cascades *without* the `e_sunshade` fade, an indoor

> LIGHTINGDIR). On the other 25, `suncast 1` will stamp a sun shadow on indoor floors.

**Companion cfg changes** (`C:\FTEQuake\quakers\cfg\default.cfg`): `r_shadows_propshadows_suncast 1`
and `r_shadows_sunfade 0.25` added, with the trade-off written into the comment block. The
propshadows debug line now also reports `suncast=` and `shadefade=`.

**Unrelated pre-existing crash found while boot-testing:** the *client* binary run with `-dedicated`
dies with `0xC0000094` (integer divide by zero) on map load. It reproduces identically on the
pre-120c binary, so it predates this work; the real dedicated server (`fteqwsv64.exe`, the `sv-rel`
target) boots every map correctly, which is why it had not been noticed. Root-caused and partly
fixed in **Patch 120d** — note the first-pass claim here that it correlated with the `LIGHTINGDIR`
lump was **wrong**, drawn from too small a sample; see 120d.

### Patch 120d — `fteqw64.exe -dedicated` map load: five faults  *(APPLIED — m-rel + sv-rel)*

**Files:** `engine/client/image.c`, `engine/client/wad.c`, `engine/client/renderer.c`,
`engine/client/render.h`, `engine/gl/gl_model.c`.

One of these — the `com_token` race in fault 2 — is a **data race present in the normal graphical
client on every map load**, and is worth having on its own merits regardless of dedicated mode.

Chased down from the crash noted in 120c. Caught under gdb, symbolised against the build's `.db`:

```
SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception          => 0x...eb49:  div %r9d      (r9d == 0)
                                         0x...eb4c:  mov %edx,%eax  <- returns the REMAINDER
hash.c <- hash.c <- image.c <- image.c <- gl_model.c <- common.c <- sys_win_threads.c
```

`Hash_Key*()` ends in `key % table->numbuckets`. `imagetable` is initialised in `Image_Init()`, which
is called from **`R_ApplyRenderer()` only** (`client/renderer.c:1732`) — i.e. only once a real
renderer is up. The model loaders call `Image_FindTexture()` unconditionally, so a client build
started with `-dedicated` reached `Hash_GetInsensitive()` with `numbuckets == 0` and died in `div` on
a worker thread the instant a map was loaded.

Fixed by initialising the table **statically** at its declaration. It costs nothing —
`imagetablebuckets` is static storage and therefore already zero-filled, which is exactly
`Hash_InitTable`'s documented precondition. `Image_Init()` now only initialises when the table is
still empty, so it cannot wipe entries registered before the renderer came up.

*Safe across `vid_restart`:* `Image_Shutdown()` walks `imagelist` and `Hash_RemoveDataInsensitive`s
every entry individually, so the table is genuinely empty by the time `Image_Init()` runs again —
skipping the re-init is equivalent, not a leak.

**CORRECTION to the note in 120c:** the crash does **not** correlate with the `LIGHTINGDIR` lump.
That was inferred from three maps that happened to have one. Re-tested against maps with no
deluxemap — `css_dust2_go`, `fy_iceworld`, `streets`, `spleef`, `testing` — and every one crashed
too. It is essentially every real map; only trivial ones (`start`, `sunvistest`) survived, because
they load few or no external textures.

The hash table was the first of **five** distinct faults on that path, each hidden behind the last.
All five are fixed; `fteqw64.exe -dedicated` now loads maps. Found by building `m-dbg` and walking
each crash under gdb.

*(The debug target does not link on this toolchain — `Makefile:1539` passes `-Wl,--no-dynamicbase`,
which ld 16.1 removed. Build it with `make m-dbg FTE_TARGET=win64 DEBUG_LDFLAGS=-Wl,--disable-dynamicbase`.
Worth knowing: `_DEBUG` also enables `COM_AssertMainThread`, which is what caught fault 2.)*

**2. `com_token` data race in `Mod_LoadQ1FogVolumes` (`gl_model.c`) — affects EVERY build.**
`COM_Parse(d)` is a macro for `COM_ParseOut(d, com_token, sizeof(com_token))`, and `com_token` is one
65536-byte global shared engine-wide. This fork's fog-volume parser used it while running on a
**worker thread** (`Mod_LoadModelWorker` → `Mod_LoadBrushModel`), racing whatever the main thread was
parsing. `_DEBUG` builds abort outright ("Not on main thread: COM_ParseOut: com_token"); release
builds silently let the two corrupt each other's tokens. **This is a map-load data race on every map
in the graphical client too, not a dedicated-mode issue** — it is the most valuable fix in this
patch. Now parses into a local buffer.

**3. NULL `rf` dereferences (`image.c`).** `rf` is `currentrendererstate.renderer`, NULL when no
renderer was applied. `Image_LoadTextureMips` called `rf->IMG_LoadTextureMips` unguarded, reached
from a QC `precache_model` via `COM_WorkerPartialSync` draining the load queue on the main thread.
Guarded, along with the three other unguarded `rf->` sites; `IMG_UpdateFiltering` already had the
`if (rf && ...)` guard, so the convention was already there. With no renderer the existing failure
path (`TF_INVALID` / `TEX_FAILED`) is the correct answer.

**4. NULL `wadmutex` (`wad.c`, `image.c`).** `Sys_LockMutex(NULL)` is `EnterCriticalSection(NULL)`.
The mutex was created in `Image_Init` — renderer-gated like everything else — and destroyed in
`Image_Shutdown`. Two of the ten lock sites in `wad.c` open-coded `if (wadmutex)`; the other eight
did not. Fixed at both ends: `Image_InitCore()` (new, called from `Renderer_Init`, which `Host_Init`
runs in **both** modes) owns it for the process lifetime and `Image_Shutdown` no longer destroys it;
and all ten sites now go through `W_LockWads()` / `W_UnlockWads()` so a new call site cannot get it
wrong.

**5. NULL `texinfo->texture` in `ModQ1_Batches_BuildQ1Q2Poly` (`gl_model.c`).** With no renderer the
miptextures are never loaded, and **server** QC reaches this through the `getsurface*` builtins
(`PF_getsurfacenumpoints` → `PF_BuildSurfaceMesh`) during entity spawn — this mod does exactly that.
Guarded; leaving st unnormalised is what the existing `vwidth == 0` branch already does.

Also guarded `Surf_BuildModelLightmaps` in `Mod_ModelLoaded` on `qrenderer != QR_NONE`, matching the
alias branch two lines below it. `r_surf.c` contains no dedicated guards anywhere, and lightmaps are
purely visual — `Mod_LightmapAllocSurf` already bails on `isDedicated`.

**Verified:** `fteqw64.exe -dedicated` boots 2fort, css_dust2_go, parkour, fy_iceworld, streets and
notnormals; the graphical client loads 2fort with video; `fteqwsv64.exe` still boots. No new
`ssqccore.txt`.

**Graphical-client risk is nil by construction:** every change is either inert with a renderer
present (`if (rf)` where `rf` is non-NULL, `qrenderer != QR_NONE`), literally equivalent (the static
hash-table init uses the same arguments `Hash_InitTable` did; `W_LockWads` is the same call when the
mutex exists), or strictly safer (not destroying the mutex removes a NULL window; the local parse
buffer removes a race). `fteqwsv64.exe` was rebuilt and redeployed alongside so both binaries carry
fault 2's fix.

## Patch 121 — brush models with `±inf` bounds no longer NaN the world collision mesh  *(APPLIED — `m-rel` + `sv-rel`; no header change, plugins unaffected)*

**Symptom.** On `fy_killzone`, every `prop_physics` fell straight through the floor. They landed
on `func_door` and nothing else; converting that door to `func_detail` (which the compiler merges
into worldspawn) made them fall through it too. `2fort` was fine.

**Cause.** The map's own BSP:

```
fy_killzone.bsp [BSP2]  model 0: mins=(-inf,-inf,-inf) maxs=(+inf,+inf,+inf)
2fort.bsp       [v29]   model 0: mins=(-2143,-1663,-223) maxs=(2143,1663,471)
```

Some compilers write the WORLD model's bounds as ±infinity instead of its real extents.
`Mod_LoadSubmodels` passes them straight through — its "spread the mins/maxs by a pixel" `-1`/`+1`
leaves an infinity untouched — and `model->mins/maxs` inherit them.

Most of the engine tolerates that, which is why it went unnoticed. Rigid-body physics does not.
`World_Box3D_Frame_BodyFromEntity` (`common/com_phys_box3d.c`) takes

```c
VectorAvg(entmins, entmaxs, geomcenter);      // (-inf + +inf) / 2  ==  NaN
```

and `GenerateCollisionMesh_BSP` (`server/world.c`) then does `VectorSubtract(vec, geomcenter, ...)`
for **every** world vertex. The entire static world collision mesh comes out NaN, so Box3D collides
with none of it. Brush ENTITIES keep finite bounds and still build valid meshes — hence props
resting on a `func_door` while passing through everything else, and hence the `func_detail` test
(merging into model 0) reproducing the fall-through. The `massval * geomsize[0..2] == 0` guard right
below does not catch it either: `inf*inf*inf` is not `0`.

**Fix.** `Mod_FixNonFiniteModelBounds` (`gl/gl_model.c`), called from the submodel setup loop
immediately after `VectorCopy(bm->mins/maxs, submod->mins/maxs)` and **before** `RadiusFromBounds`
(which would otherwise inherit the infinity). If any component fails `IS_NAN` — whose mask is the
exponent, so it is true for infinities as well as NaNs — the bounds are recomputed from the model's
own faces.

Deliberately the EDGE path (`surfedges` → `edges` → `vertexes`) rather than `surf->mesh`:
`mesh->xyz_array` is filled by the renderer, so a dedicated server has none, and a dedicated server
is precisely where this has to keep working. A model with no faces is left a degenerate but FINITE
box — anything beats a NaN.

Logged with `Con_Printf`, not `Con_DPrintf`: the engine is papering over a defect in the BSP and the
mapper should see it. One line per affected model, so a healthy map stays silent.

**Verified.** Dedicated server, `+map fy_killzone`:

```
maps/fy_killzone.bsp: model 0 has non-finite bounds; recomputed from 27606 faces as
    -980 -1152 -16 .. 316 1784 464 (recompile the map to fix properly)
```

`+map 2fort` produces no message — untouched, as intended.

**Note for the mapper.** This is a runtime repair, not a substitute for a correct BSP. The ±inf
bounds are still in the file and any other tool reading it sees them.

**Recompiling does NOT clear it** — tested. A fresh `fy_killzone` build (2026-07-30, 30006 faces)
still writes `model 0 mins=(-inf,-inf,-inf) maxs=(inf,inf,inf)`. ericw-tools reproduces it
deterministically for this map, so "just recompile" is not available as a workaround and the engine
repair is the only thing standing between this map and total loss of world physics.

Where it comes from, compiler side:

- `qbsp/writebsp.cc:301` — `dmodel.mins[i] = headnode->bounds.mins()[i] + SIDESPACE;`
  The model bounds are copied straight off the tree headnode with **no finiteness check**. Leaves
  get one (`writebsp.cc:167`, throws "leaf bounds was unassigned"); the model headnode does not.
- `qbsp/brushbsp.cc:1327-1333` — `tree.bounds` accumulates brush bounds, then
  `node->bounds = tree.bounds.grow(SIDESPACE)`. An unfed/degenerate `tree.bounds` propagates
  straight into the written model.

The compile log states the consequence outright:

```
LIMITS EXCEEDED ON dnode_t::mins
NOTE: limits exceeded for Quake BSP - switching to Quake BSP2
```

`dnode_t::mins` is a `short` (±32768) and the map's own reported extent is **5008 units**, so
nothing legitimate can blow that limit. The infinite headnode bounds are what forced the BSP2
downgrade — one defect, two symptoms. 2fort compiles with identical flags and stays v29 precisely
because its bounds are finite.

Spread within the file: model 0, the root node, **33 of 3605 nodes and 4 of 2042 leafs** carry ±inf.
All 31 submodels are finite — which is exactly why props landed on `func_door` and nothing else, and
why reclassifying that door as `func_detail` (merging it into model 0) made them fall through there
too. That was the decisive clue.

Player and bullet collision were never affected: the map is compiled `-noclip -wrbrushes`
(`0 clipnodes`), so hull traces run off the BSPX `BRUSHLIST` lump, which is finite. Only the physics
path reads `model->mins/maxs`, via:

`com_phys_box3d.c:360` `VectorScale(model->mins, scale, entmins)` → `:394` `geomsize = inf` →
`:441` `VectorAvg(entmins, entmaxs, geomcenter)` = `(-inf + +inf)/2` = **NaN** →
`world.c:3239` `VectorSubtract(vec, geomcenter, …)` applied to every world vertex → the entire
static world collision mesh is NaN → Box3D collides with none of it.

The nearby sanity guard at `com_phys_box3d.c:444`
(`massval * geomsize[0]*geomsize[1]*geomsize[2] == 0`) does not catch this: `inf*inf*inf` is `inf`,
not `0`.

## Patch 122 — `r_shadows` became a chat message; console gains completion-accept, page scroll and sticky scrollback  *(APPLIED — `m-rel`; no header layout change, plugins unaffected)*

Four separate console-layer changes. Only the first is a bug fix; the other three are features
Lex asked for. All are client-side (`client/keys.c`, `client/console.c`) except the `Cmd_IsCommand`
rewrite, which lands in `common/cmd.c`.

### 122a — `r_shadows 0` was silently broadcast as chat  *(the actual bug)*

**Symptom.** Typing `r_shadows 0` in the console printed `Player: r_shadows 0` in chat instead of
setting the cvar. `r_shadows` is registered perfectly normally (`client/renderer.c:535`, registered
at `:1110`); `cvarlist` finds it; only the console refused it. Confirmed in Lex's own
`quakers/qconsole.log` — five occurrences of `Player: r_shadows…`.

**Cause — a fixed 50-entry array, overflowed by this fork's own cvars.**

`cl_chatmode 2` (the default, `console.c:72`) decides command-vs-chat by asking
`Cmd_IsCommand(line)` (`keys.c:654`). That asked the **tab-completion** machinery:

```c
cmd = Cmd_CompleteCommand (command, true, false, -1, NULL);   //matchnum -1 == "exact match only"
if (!cmd || strcmp (cmd, command)) return false;              // just a chat message
```

`matchnum < 0` scans only the entries **stored in `c->completions[]`** (`cmd.c:2653-2663`) — and
that array is a hard-capped 50:

```c
} completions[50];                            // common/cmd.h:178
...
if (res->num == countof(res->completions))    // common/cmd.c:2485
{
    res->extra++;
    return;                                   // no more space for more options
}
```

Two things conspire to overflow it for this exact name:

1. `Cmd_IsCommand` truncates the line to its **first token**, so `Cmd_Complete` sees
   `partial == "r_shadows"` with `partial[len] == 0`. That enables the `!partial[len] ||`
   disjunct at `cmd.c:2617`/`2635` and degenerates the filter into a pure **prefix** match — every
   `r_shadows*` cvar matches.
2. This fork + the quakers mod now register **53** names beginning with `r_shadows`: 35 from
   `"Realtime Lighting"` (33 cvars + the `r_shadows_fakedistance` / `r_shadows_fakeres` `name2`
   aliases, which `Cmd_Complete` emits as their own entries), 15 more created by the `set`s in
   `quakers/cfg/default.cfg` into `"Custom variables"`, 2 more from the `!!cvardf` pragmas in
   `quakers/glsl/*.glsl` into `"GLSL Variables"` — plus plain `r_shadows` in `"Graphical Nicaties"`.

Both `cvar_groups` and `group->cvars` are built **head-first** (`cvar.c:198-199`, `cvar.c:1341-1343`),
so the **earliest-created group is walked LAST**. `"Graphical Nicaties"` is created at
`renderer.c:868`, before `Sh_RegisterCvars()` creates `"Realtime Lighting"` at `renderer.c:965`, and
long before the config and shader groups. So plain `r_shadows` is offered to an **already-full**
array, gets counted into `res->extra`, and is thrown away. The exact-match scan finds nothing,
`Cmd_IsCommand` returns false, and `keys.c:660-669` prefixes the line with `say `.

The margin is a knife-edge: 35 + 15 = **exactly 50**, so `r_shadows` is candidate #51. One fewer
mod cvar and the bug disappears — which is precisely why this looked intermittent.

Note the *chat* conversion also requires `cls.state >= ca_connected` (`keys.c:662`); while
disconnected the line falls to `keys.c:671-672` and execs anyway. That is why it works at the main
menu and only fails in game.

**Fix.** Ask the question the executor asks, not the completion list. New `Cmd_IsKnownName` in
`common/cmd.c` (it has to live there — `cmd_functions` is `static` at `cmd.c:1570`), walking
commands then aliases then cvars directly. `Cmd_IsCommand` in `keys.c` becomes a token copy plus
one call.

Two deliberate decisions:

- **Case-SENSITIVE**, matching the old code exactly (`Cmd_Complete` with `caseinsens=false`, then
  `strcmp`). Mirroring the executor's case-*insensitive* lookup would be more self-consistent, but
  it would also make typing `KILL` or `QUIT` in chat silently execute the command. `Cvar_FindVar`'s
  hash *is* insensitive, so the cvar branch re-checks the case (and accepts `name2`, which the old
  completion walk offered as its own entry).
- **No restriction filtering.** This answers "is this a known name", not "may you run it". Using
  `Cmd_AliasExist(name, RESTRICT_LOCAL)` would make a restriction-elevated alias fail the test and
  get **broadcast as public chat** instead of reaching the cbuf, which prints `was restricted`
  locally. Existence and permission are different questions.

Net behavioural delta: **only** names past the 50-match truncation change answer. Nothing else.

**Also fixed, in `Cmd_Complete_Check` (`cmd.c:2485`)** — the same truncation meant Tab could not
*list* or complete `r_shadows` either, and `Key_UpdateCompletionDesc` could not show its value. An
exact match now steals the last slot rather than being dropped, and `res->extra` is only incremented
when something was genuinely omitted (it was over-counting otherwise). The array stays at 50 —
growing it only moves the cliff; this removes it for the case that matters.

> This is a general defect, not an `r_shadows` one: **any** command or cvar whose name is a prefix
> of 50+ other names hits it.

### 122b — RIGHTARROW accepts the inline completion (`con_acceptcompletion`, default 1)

`Con_DrawInput` already paints the completed remainder in green at `console.c:1592-1602`. Right
arrow at end-of-line was a no-op (`keys.c:1672`, a previous nettest fix). It now accepts that hint,
shell-autosuggestion style — the same accept Ctrl+Space performs.

The guard mirrors the paint's condition clause for clause, so the key is only stolen while green
text is genuinely on screen: `con->commandcompletion` (excludes plugin/cluster subconsoles, the
`Con_Navigate` URL bar and the text editor), `con_showcompletion`, the same emptiness test, caret at
end of line, a single leading `/` only, `max(1, con_commandmatch)`, and `strlen(fname) > typedlen`
(an equal-or-shorter suggestion paints zero green chars).

One extra test the paint does not need: `CompleteCommand` inserts `completions[idx].repl` when set
(argument completions only) and **returns without changing anything** if that is shorter than what
is typed (`keys.c:543`). Without checking the accepted string's length first, right arrow would eat
the keypress and do nothing visible. Ctrl and shift variants, `K_GP_DPAD_RIGHT` (the only way to
move the caret on a pad), and `con_findmode` all fall through to normal cursor movement.

`con_showcompletion` had to lose its `static` in `console.c:70` for this to link.

### 122c — PgUp/PgDn page a whole console window (`con_pagelines` 0, `con_pageoverlap` 2)

Was a fixed 2 lines (8 with ctrl), shared with the mouse wheel. The page keys now step
`window height / Font_CharVHeight(font_console) - 2 - con_pageoverlap` rows; **the wheel and gamepad
stick keep the old 2/8 feel**. `con_pagelines 2` restores the old behaviour exactly. Ctrl still means
*faster*, not slower.

The row count is derived from `con->vislines` (or `wnd_h` for a `CONF_ISWINDOW` console) rather than
cached by the renderer, so this needs no draw-path hook. `Font_CharVHeight` takes an explicit font,
so unlike `Font_CharHeight` it does not depend on whichever font happened to be bound last.

**The load-bearing part is the two new end-clamps, not the step size.** Neither walk loop clamped
the leftover `displayscroll` when it ran out of lines:

- PgUp exits `while (displayscroll >= display->numlines)` with the remainder intact at the oldest
  line. That remainder becomes the renderer's `chop` (`console.c:2212`), `y += chop` (`:2230`) shoves
  the origin down, and the row loop `continue`s past everything — the console draws **nothing but
  the `^^^^` marker**.
- PgDn exits `while (displayscroll < 0)` **negative** whenever you are less than a page from the live
  end. The snap-to-bottom at `keys.c:2107` cannot catch it (it tests `display->newer == con->current`,
  but `newer` is `NULL` there). The view draws that many rows too high with a blank gap below — and,
  worse, `Con_PrintCon`'s auto-follow gate requires `displayscroll == 0` (`console.c:1050`), so the
  console **silently stops following new output** until you press End.

At the old 2-line step the leftover was at most 2 rows and invisible. At a full-page step it is a
broken console. Both loops now clamp to 0 at the ends, matching what Home and the mouse-drag path
(`keys.c:730-734`, `:743-747`) already did. A `numlines < 1` floor was added too, so a line the
renderer never walked cannot be consumed for free.

### 122d — the console remembers where you were reading (`con_keepscroll`, default 1)

`console.c:3298` snapped a closed/unfocused console window to the live tail every frame — a previous
nettest fix, whose comment says it "kills the stuck `^^^^`".

**Simply not resetting would have been a serious regression, and both halves matter:**

1. With `con_window 1` (which quakers sets, `cfg/default.cfg:437`), `con_window_cb` clears
   `CONF_NOTIFY` from `con_main` (`console.c:89`), so `Con_DrawNotify` skips it — **the faded hidden
   window IS the in-game notify overlay**. `Con_DrawConsoleLines` only ever walks *older* than the
   line it is handed (`console.c:2300`), so drawing from a scrolled-up `display` makes every new
   console and chat print invisible in game.
2. Its `^^^^` backscroll marker is emitted at `console.c:2214-2221`, **before** the `lineagelimit`
   fade test at `:2305-2318`, with no alpha. A stale `display` parks a permanent full-brightness row
   of `^` over the game view.

So the shape is **save then draw the live tail then restore**, entirely inside `Con_DrawConsole`. The
hidden console keeps drawing and fading exactly as before; the reading position is put back after
the draw, so reopening lands where you left off.

The position is stored as an **integer distance from `con->current`**, not a pointer:
`Con_DrawConsoleLines` registers link images (`console.c:2336-2372`), which can `Con_Printf` on
failure, which can evict and free a line mid-draw — and the eviction fixup at `console.c:1010-1011`
only knows about `con->display`. Walking back from the never-freed `current` line means an eviction
costs a row or two of accuracy instead of a dangling pointer. No new `console_t` fields, no new
fixup sites.

The non-windowed main console never reset in the first place (nothing writes `con_current->display`
outside `Con_DrawConsole`'s NULL guard), and its notify overlay reads `con->current` independently,
so `con_window 0` is unaffected either way.

### Verification

`m-rel` builds clean — **zero warnings** from `keys.c`, `console.c` and `cmd.c`. Graphical client
smoke-tested twice on `2fort` (640x480 windowed, 30 s, `-condebug`): map loads, player connects,
physics starts, no errors in the log beyond the pre-existing `GNUTLS` / `.lit` notices.

The four behaviours are all input-driven and need in-game confirmation:

| Check | Expected |
|---|---|
| `r_shadows 0` in console, in game | sets the cvar; first token paints **yellow**, not sent as chat |
| `r_shad` + Tab | list now includes plain `r_shadows` |
| type `r_sha`, press right arrow | line completes, same as Tab |
| PgUp / PgDn | one full window; wheel still fine-grained |
| PgDn at the live end, then print | console still auto-follows (the clamp) |
| scroll up, close console, reopen | lands where you left off |
| while closed, with `con_window 1` | notify text still appears; **no** stray `^^^^` over the view |

Escape hatches, all live cvars: `con_acceptcompletion 0`, `con_pagelines 2`, `con_keepscroll 0`.

## Patch 123 — the missing third of the frame: `r_speeds` structurally could not see a GPU stall, and `sys_framepacing 4` was one  *(APPLIED — `m-rel`; no header change, plugins unaffected)*

**Symptom.** fy_killzone with all 66 `prop_physics` ran at ~360 fps and nobody could say why. Adding
up every `r_speeds 2` bucket left **~1138 µs unaccounted inside `Total refresh`** — 33% of the frame,
attributed to nothing. It scaled with `r_renderscale` but did not appear in `CSQC Drawing`, which
ruled out the scene render itself.

**Why more bucketing was never going to find it.** `RSpeedEnd` only issues its own `qglFinish` when
`r_speeds > 2` (`client/render.h`). At the `r_speeds 2` anyone actually measures with, **no child
bucket contains a GPU sync at all**, so GPU-tail time is *structurally* forced into the unattributed
remainder of the parent. Three rounds of new buckets (postproc/resolve; the cost of drawing the
r_speeds table itself; then five brackets covering every remaining statement in `GLSCR_UpdateScreen`)
each came back near zero and each narrowed it correctly — the residual was never CPU work.

**Cause.** `Sys_FramePacePresentActive()` is true whenever `sys_framepacing == 4` on OpenGL, and
`cfg/settings.cfg` sets 4. That armed the pre-swap drain in `gl/gl_screen.c`: `qglFenceSync`
immediately followed by `qglClientWaitSync` on *that same fence* — block until the GPU has retired
every command submitted this frame. It sat outside every bucket. At a fixed viewpoint (340 draw
calls, 2.0M indices):

| | `r_renderscale 2` | `r_renderscale 1` |
|---|---|---|
| `Total refresh` | 2764.51 µs | 2576.52 µs |
| *(new)* `Frame pacing` | 623.09 µs | 501.51 µs |
| with the drain off | 2076.21 µs | 2061.48 µs |

That last row is the finding: **with the drain off, `r_renderscale 2` costs 14.7 µs** — 4× the pixels
for nothing. The GPU was never the limiter. The drain was forbidding frame N's GPU work from
overlapping frame N+1's CPU work and charging the tail latency to the CPU every frame. This also
refutes the intermediate conclusion "we are GPU-bound", which the same data appeared to support
before the drain was isolated.

**Fix — `sys_framepacing_drain` (`client/sys_win.c`), default 2.** A rotating fence ring
(`gl_framepace_fence[]`, owned by `gl/gl_vidcommon.c` so it is zeroed where the entry points are
bound — i.e. on every context creation, because a `GLsync` from a destroyed context must never be
waited on). Depth 1 reproduces the old behaviour; depth 2 waits on frame N−1's fence, still capping
queue depth at one frame but keeping the pipeline overlapped; 3 waits two back; 0 disables.

**The drain was never earning its keep.** Swept with `cl_maxfps 300` so the paced hold actually
engaged (target interval 3.333 ms):

| `_drain` | interval | jitter (stddev) | `Frame pacing` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (old) | 4.167 ms → 240.0 fps | **1445.2 µs** | 1800.35 µs |
| **2 (new default)** | **3.360 ms → 297.6 fps** | **295.0 µs** | 1080.85 µs |
| 3 | 3.568 ms → 280.3 fps | 871.4 µs | 967.82 µs |
| 0 | 3.646 ms → 274.3 fps | 976.1 µs | 856.35 µs |

Depth 1 was so expensive it ate the whole 3.333 ms budget, so the pacer could not reach its grid slot
and the cadence collapsed — *worse* jitter than not draining at all. Depth 0 sawtooths at 976 µs
because the GPU backlog runs deep, which is the real problem the drain was written to solve. Only
N−1 gets the bound without the serialisation. **Bounding queue depth flattens cadence; bounding it to
zero costs more than it buys.**

Also: with `cl_maxfps 0`, `Sys_FramePacePresent` early-outs on `fps <= 0`, so mode 4 does *nothing
but drain* — ~600 µs/frame for a pacing feature that never runs.

### 123a — new `RSPEED_` buckets

`RSPEED_POSTPROC` (18.7 µs), `RSPEED_RSPEEDSHOW` (~55 µs — the cost of drawing the very table being
read, which was inflating the residual being chased), `RSPEED_SCR_SETUP` / `_COMPOSITE` / `_BRIGHTEN`
/ `_PACING` / `_RESET` covering every remaining statement in `GLSCR_UpdateScreen`, and
`RSPEED_SHADOW_CLASSIFY` / `_ENTDRAW` splitting the shadow bucket. `Total refresh` now reconciles with
its children to **under 10 µs**, down from ~1138.

### 123b — `r_speeds_dump` (`client/cl_screen.c`)

Prints the sample table to the console as text. With `-condebug` the exact figures land in
`qconsole.log`, so reconciliation arithmetic runs on numbers rather than on a downscaled screenshot.
One-shot flag consumed by the next `RSpeedShow`.

### 123c — `r_shadows_propshadows_max` default 13 → 8

`sh_propsub_budget` is sized from this cvar, not the live cell count (Patch 120, deliberately, so
resolution never steps). `Sh_PropSubCellRect` picks quarter-size subcells only while
`nsub <= (4-nc)*4`; at the shipped `r_shadows_cascades 2` that threshold is 8, so a budget of 13
failed it and **every lamp shadow got a 256 px cell instead of 512 px** — a quarter of the pixel
area. 8 vs 13 measured 442.18 vs 453.16 µs with identical draw calls (i.e. free), and 8 still exceeds
any live cell count on the mod's maps (6 map lights → 5 cells). With `cascades 3` the threshold drops
to 4 and this would need to be ≤ 4.

### 123d — shadow bucket decomposition

The split is ~50/50 — `classify` 219.75 µs vs `entdraw` 204.18 µs — so neither half dominates and
neither fix alone is decisive. Both live atlas faces pass `smesh = NULL`, so **no world geometry is
rendered into the shadow atlas at all**; the cost is entirely the per-caster classification loop plus
the repeated entity-list walks the engine itself flags at `gl/gl_shadow.c:2676` (*"fixme: this walks
through the entity lists up to 6 times per frame per entity"*). The classification loop has **no
distance or frustum rejection** before the expensive work — `camdist` is computed and then used only
as a ranking multiplier ~100 lines later.

`RF_NOSHADOW` *is* the first rejection in that loop, which is why the mod-side
`r_props_shadowdist 1000` cull moves both sub-buckets together (classify → 102.19, entdraw → 123.59)
and drops `Shadowmap Sides` 7 → 3: excluding distant props stops whole lamp cells being allocated.

**End to end at `r_renderscale 2`, shipped defaults before vs after: 2764.51 → 2178.95 µs,
361.73 → 458.94 fps (+27%).**

### Still open — measured, not yet fixed, and NOT independently verified

- Shadow atlas has **no frame-to-frame caching**: the 2048² depth texture is cleared and every face
  re-rendered each frame, though lamp-cell projections are provably constant (Patch 120a) and their
  casters are sleeping props. Biggest remaining shadow win; needs the whole-texture clear replaced.
- `CL_PredictMove` traces against all 66 `SOLID_PHYSICS_TRIMESH` props with **no broadphase** —
  `PM_TransformedHullCheck` jumps straight to `PM_HullTrace`, bypassing the AABB rejects. ~175 ns per
  prop per trace, ~75% of it six double-precision `sin`/`cos` in `AngleVectorsMesh`. Est. 60–120 µs.
- `Opaque Batches` (533–640 µs): vertex attribute pointers re-specified on every batch, and uniforms
  have only an all-or-nothing `entunchanged` flag that `GLBE_SelectEntity` defeats per entity. Est.
  ~131 µs. No instancing support exists anywhere in the GL backend.
- `World walking` (312–379 µs) is reportedly a **DRAM bandwidth** problem, not algorithmic:
  `msurface_t` is 288 bytes, the array is 8.7 MB, and the walk touches all five cache lines of ~20 k
  surfaces ≈ 7 MB/frame ≈ 22.6 GB/s. Also PVS from that view leaf is 1534/1719 clusters (**89.2%
  visible**) — fy_killzone is effectively unvised, which is map-side.
- **Latent:** baked prop lighting binds its colour array from **client memory**
  (`gl/gl_alias.c:1961`, `vbo = 0` + sysmem pointer), so the driver copies ~53 KB per prop per frame.
  Inert on fy_killzone (no `RGBPROPLIGHT` lump) but will bite on any map carrying one.

The adversarial verification pass on these four died on a session limit, so they are leads rather
than findings. Given that `r_props_shadowdist 1200` looked well-reasoned and culled *exactly zero*
props — the `PP_CULL_HYST` offset makes the effective radius `value + 192`, and the farthest prop was
1371 — each should be measured before any code is written.

## Patch 124 — rawinput discarded legacy mouse buttons for devices it never enumerated  *(APPLIED — `m-rel`; no header change, plugins unaffected)*

> **Numbering note.** The commit that introduced this (`c9305a293`) is titled "Patch 123" in error —
> 123 was already taken by the frame-pacing work (`c69b933c3`, plus `2628b026f` = 123e). It is
> Patch 124. History was left alone rather than force-pushed, because a second machine has the

**Symptom.** Menus were completely unclickable on a laptop. Taps *and* press-and-hold produced no
`K_MOUSE1` at all. `in_rawinput 0` was the interim workaround.

**Cause.** `INS_MouseEvent` decided whether to honour a legacy `WM_*BUTTON*` press with
`if (!rawmicecount) IN_KeyEvent(...); else mstate &= ~(1<<i);`. `rawmicecount` is a **global** count
of raw-enumerated mice, and a legacy button message does not say which device produced it — so the
moment *any* mouse was raw-covered, *every* device's legacy buttons were discarded, including devices
raw input had never enumerated.

A Windows precision touchpad is a HID digitizer, not a `RIM_TYPEMOUSE`. It never reports
`RI_MOUSE_BUTTON_*` flags, so `INS_RawInput_MouseRead` has nothing to deliver on its behalf and the
legacy message was the only press it had.

**Why it was hard to find.** Motion was unaffected. The free-cursor path (`mouseactive == false`,
which `setcursormode(TRUE)` selects for menus) reads `GetCursorPos` directly with no rawinput
involvement, so the cursor tracked normally and SUI hover highlighting followed it correctly. It
presented as a **dead hit-test rather than as missing input**. ENTER (keyboard) and the touchscreen
(`K_TOUCH`) both kept working, pointing further away from the button path.

**Fix.** Record what raw input actually accounted for, per button, for the five buttons it has
`usButtonFlags` for, and drop the legacy message only for those. Buttons past those five keep the old
blanket behaviour — they arrive via `ulRawButtons` and would otherwise double up.

Two pieces of state are required, and the second was missing from the first cut:

| | purpose |
|---|---|
| `rawbuttontime[5]` | `Sys_DoubleTime()` of the last raw transition. `WM_INPUT` for a physical click precedes the synthesised legacy message, so a transition within 100 ms identifies the genuine duplicate — from the very first press, with no warm-up click. |
| `rawbuttondown[5]` | whether raw currently holds it down. |

**`rawbuttondown` is not redundant.** `WM_MOUSEMOVE` falls into the same window-proc `case` block as
the button messages (`gl/gl_vidnt.c`, and the d3d/sw equivalents) and calls `INS_MouseEvent` with the
live `MK_*` flags. A suppressed press never reaches `sysmouse.oldbuttons` — the `else` branch clears
the bit out of `mstate`, and `oldbuttons = mstate` runs at the end. So on the timestamp alone:

1. Press and hold on a raw mouse → raw stamps the time, legacy press correctly suppressed,
   `oldbuttons` bit stays **clear**.
2. Raw reports *transitions*, not held state, so no new stamp arrives while it is held.
3. 100 ms later any `WM_MOUSEMOVE` carries the button bit, `oldbuttons` is clear, the time test now
   passes — **a spurious second press on every drag.**

Tracking the hold closes it. `DOWN` is applied before `UP` within a packet so a click fast enough to
report both edges at once settles as released rather than latching down forever, and both arrays are
cleared in `INS_RawInput_DeInit` and at re-enumeration — a device unplugged mid-press never sends its
`UP`, and a latched `rawbuttondown` would suppress that button's legacy messages permanently,
reinstating the very bug this exists to fix.

The recording block sits deliberately **outside** the `vid.activeapp` test in
`INS_RawInput_MouseRead`: releases are dispatched even when unfocused, and a release we failed to
record would let the next legacy press through as a duplicate.

**Rejected:** detecting touchpads by device name — a heuristic arms race against touchpad drivers,
where this simply stops discarding input that nothing accounted for.

**Residual risk.** Legacy messages carry no device id, so if a raw mouse button is genuinely held at
the instant a touchpad tap arrives, the tap is still suppressed. That ambiguity is not resolvable
from a legacy message and is not worth chasing.

**Testing status.** Compiles clean (`m-rel FTE_TARGET=win64`, gcc 16.1.0) adding no new warnings — 3
before, 3 after, all pre-existing (two `-Waddress` on `sysname`, one `-Wenum-int-mismatch` on
`keydown`). **Neither the touchpad tap with `in_rawinput 1` nor the drag-with-held-button regression
has been exercised on hardware.** Both need a physical test.
